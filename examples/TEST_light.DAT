IS RECORDED AND DEEP SPACE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WHERE THE RELATIVELY SIMPLE
CODING EQUIPMENT CAN BE PLACED ABOARD THE SPACECRAFT BUT THE MORE COMPLEX
DECODING PROCEDURE MUST BE PERFORMED ON EARTH  MOST OF THE CODED SYSTEMS IN
USE TODAY EMPLOY SOME FORM OF FEC EVEN IF THE CHANNEL IS NOT ONEWAY THIS BOOK
IS MOSTLY DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF FEC SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS OF
FEC TO STORAGE AND COMMUNICATIN SYSTEMS ARE PRESENTED SOMEWHERE ELSE IN SOME CA
SES A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM CAN BE TWO WAY THAT IS INFORMATION CAN BE SENT IN
BOTH DIRECTIONS AND TRANSMITTER ALSO ACTS AS A RECEIVER AND VICE VERSA
AND THE EXAMPLES OF TWO WAY SYSTEMS ARE TELEPHONE LINES AND SOME SATTELITE
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ERROR CONTROL FOR A TWO SYSTEM CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED
USING ERROR DETECTION AND TRANSMISSION CALLED AUTOMATIC REPEAT REQUEST ARQ
WHEN ERRORS ARE DETECTED AT THE RECEIVER A REQUEST IS SENT TO THE TRANSMITTER
TO REPEAT THE MESSAGE AND THIS CONTINUES UNTIL THE MESSAGE IS RECEIVED CORRECTL
Y AUTOMATIC FILE BUILD CONSTRUCTS CANDIDATE INDEXES TO AN ITEM WHERE INDEXING I
S THAT WHEN HUMAN OR MACHINE DETERMINES DISCRIPTURES FOR A PARTICULAR ITEM AND
ZIPHS LAW DETERMINES THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURANCE OF DIFFERENT WORDS

THE READER SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO DISTINGUISH BOOKS DEALING WITH FILE STRUCTURES
FROM TEXTS COVERING PRINCIPALLY DATA STRUCTURES THERE IS SOMO CONFUSION IN TERM
INOLOGY BETWEEN DATA AND FILE STRUCTURES AND BETWEEN LISTS  INDEXES  AND FILES
IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL THE TERM DATA STRUCTURE NORMALLY REFERS TO ABSTRACT
CONSTRUCTS USED TO REPRESENT THE ENTITIES AND CONCEPTS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR
EXAMPLE DOCUMENTS TERMS AND SENTENCES FILE STRUCTURE ON THE OTHER HAND REFERS
TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DOCUMENT FILES AND OF THE AUXILIARY FILES USED TO
ACCESS THE MAIN DOCUMENT FILES
EXERCISES
CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING INVERTED INDEX
D TERM C NOT TERM A
USING THE INVERTED FILE STRUCTURE FROM EXERCISE DESCRIBE A PROCEDURE WHICH
WILL IDENTIFY THE DOCUMENTS IN WHICH TERM A IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY TERM B
IF TERM A IS ASSIGNED A WEIGHT OF BY A PARTICULAR USER AND TERMS B AND C ARE
ASSIGNED WEIGHTS OF AND RESPECTIVELY WHICH DOCUMENTS WILL BE RETRIEVED BY EACH
OF THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ASSUMING A RETRIEVAL THRESHOLD OF
USING ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND AN ARBITRARY TEXT STRING CONSISTING OF MORE
THAN ONE SENTENCE DEVELOP A ROUTINE WHICH CREATES AND INVERTED INDEX FOR THE WO
RDS FROM THE TEXT AND THE ASSOCIATED SENTENCE NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE GIVEN THE
TEXT THE OBJECTS ARE PROCESSED SERIALLY THE FIRST OF THE OBJECTS BECOMES THE RE
PRESENTATIVE THE APPROPRIATE INVERTED INDEX WILL BE THE OBJECTS ARE PROCESSED
SERIALLY FIRST OR BECOMES REPRESENTATIVE

ANOTHER WAY OF ENHANCING AN INVERTED FILE SYSTEM IS TO INCLUDE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL TERMS
IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SPECIAL USAGE PATTERNS EXIST FOR THE WORDS
INCLUDED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXTS IN CERTAIN SUBJECT SPECIALTIES
IN PARTICULAR THE FREQUENCY OF USE OF A GIVEN TERM MAY CORRELATE WITH
SOME INDICATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT TERM IN THE GIVEN SUBJECT
AREA IF WORD FREQUENCY INFORMATION IS TO BE USED IN RETRIEVAL IT MUST
BE STORED IN THE SYSTEM AND THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
INCLUDE THE INFORMATION IN THE INVERTED FILE IN MANY SYSTEM POSTING
INFORMATION IS KEPT IN THE INVERTED FILE FOR EACH TERM THAT IS THE
INVERTED FILE INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS
IN WHICH A GIVEN TERM OCCURS THIS FREQUENCY INFORMATION IS REFERRED
TO AS THE NUMBER OF POSTINGS FOR THE TERM IN THIS WAY THE USER CAN
QUICKLY ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE RETRIEVED BY
USING A GIVEN TERM FOR INSTANCE THE TERM INFORMATION HAS POSTINGS IN
THE ERIC DATA BASE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DIALOG SYSTEM AT THE TIME
THIS BEING WRITTEN A QUERY WHICH INCLUDES ONLY THIS SINGLE TERM WOULD
THEREFORE RETRIEVE DOCUMENTS THE DIALOG SYSTEM IS A PRODUCT OF
LOCKHEED INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF PALO ALTO CALIFORNIA IN MAY SOME
INDIVIDUAL DATA BASES WERE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DIALOG SYSTEM THE
DIALOG SYSTEM IS BASED ON AN INVERTED FILE DESIGN THE SYSTEM CREATES
SETS OF DOCUMENT REFERENCE NUMBERS BY MEANS OF A SELECT COMMAND THUS
THE SELECT INFORMATION COMMAND CREATES A SET OF DOCUMENT REFERENCE
NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM INFORMATION THE SYSTEM PROVIDES
THE USER WITH A SET NUMBER IDENTIFYING THESE DOCUMENT REFERENCE
NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE THE STATEMENT GIVEN EARLIER WOULD BE ASSIGNED
SET NUMER ONE IF IT WERE THE FIRST SELECT COMMAND ISSUED BY THE
SEARCHER A SECOND COMMAND SELECT RETRIEVAL WOULD THEREFORE CREATE
SET NUMBER TWO THESE SETS MAY THEN BE PROCESSED BY A COMBINE
STATEMENT WHICH ALLOWS THE USE OF THE BOOLEAN OPERATORS AND OR OR
NOT THUS THE STATEMENTS COMBINE ONE AND TWO  ARE USED TO FORM THE
QUERY STATEMENT

RETRIEVAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS OFTEN MEASURED BY USING RECALL AND PRECISION
VALUES WHERE RECALL MEASURES THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO RETRIEVE USEFUL
DOCUMENTS WHILE PRECISION CONVERSELY MEASURES THE ABILITY TO REJECT USELESS
MATERIALS A HIGH LEVEL OF INDEXING EXHAUSTIVELY TENDS TO ENSURE HIGH RECALL BY
MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO RETRIEVE MOST POTENTIALLY RELEVANT ITEMS AT THE SAME
TIME PRECISION MAY SUFFER BECAUSE SOME MARIGINALLY RELEVANT ITEMS ARE LIKELY
TO BE RETRIEVED ALSO WHEN MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREAS ARE COVERED BY THE
INDEX TERMS WHEN HIGHLY SPECIFIC INDEX TERMS ARE USED THE PRECISION IS
EXPECTED TO BE HIGH SINCE MOST RETRIEVED ITEMS MAY BE EXPECTED TO BE RELEVANT
THE CONVERSE IS TRUE WHEN VERY BROAD OR GENERAL TERMS ARE USED FOR INDEXING
PURPOSES BECAUSE BROAD TERMS WILL NOT DISTINGUISH THE MARGINAL ITEMS FROM THE
TRULY RELEVANT ONES THUS TO OBTAIN HIGH RECALL AN EXHAUSTIVE INDEXING IS
USEFUL IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN INDEXING LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDES A VARIETY
OF APPROACHES TO COVER THE GIVEN SUBJECT AREA TO INSURE HIGH PRECISION A
HIGHLY SPECIFIC INDEXING LANGUAGE SHOULD BE USED AND THE TERMS SHOULD CARRY
ADDITIONAL CONTENT INDICATIONS SUCH AS TERM WEIGHTS AND RELATION INDICATIONS
TO OTHER TERMS ASSUMING THAT THE INDEXING IS PERFORMED MANUALLY BY TRAINED
PERSONS THE VARIABLES AFFECTING THE INDEXING OPERATION RELATE NOT ONLY TO
THE EXHAUSTIVITY OF THE INDEXING AND THE SPECIFICITY OF THE ASSIGNED TERMS
BUT ALSO TO THE ACCURACY OF THE ASSIGNED TERMS THE FORMULATION OF MEANINGFUL
BOOLEAN STATEMENTS IS A COMPLICATED TASK
