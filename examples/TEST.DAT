THE READER SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO DISTINGUISH BOOKS DEALING WITH FILE STRUCTURES
FROM TEXTS COVERING PRINCIPALLY DATA STRUCTURES THERE IS SOMO CONFUSION IN TERM
INOLOGY BETWEEN DATA AND FILE STRUCTURES AND BETWEEN LISTS  INDEXES  AND FILES
IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL THE TERM DATA STRUCTURE NORMALLY REFERS TO ABSTRACT
CONSTRUCTS USED TO REPRESENT THE ENTITIES AND CONCEPTS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR
EXAMPLE DOCUMENTS TERMS AND SENTENCES FILE STRUCTURE ON THE OTHER HAND REFERS
TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DOCUMENT FILES AND OF THE AUXILIARY FILES USED TO
ACCESS THE MAIN DOCUMENT FILES
EXERCISES
CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING INVERTED INDEX
D TERM C NOT TERM A
USING THE INVERTED FILE STRUCTURE FROM EXERCISE DESCRIBE A PROCEDURE WHICH
WILL IDENTIFY THE DOCUMENTS IN WHICH TERM A IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY TERM B
IF TERM A IS ASSIGNED A WEIGHT OF BY A PARTICULAR USER AND TERMS B AND C ARE
ASSIGNED WEIGHTS OF AND RESPECTIVELY WHICH DOCUMENTS WILL BE RETRIEVED BY EACH
OF THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ASSUMING A RETRIEVAL THRESHOLD OF
USING ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND AN ARBITRARY TEXT STRING CONSISTING OF MORE
THAN ONE SENTENCE DEVELOP A ROUTINE WHICH CREATES AND INVERTED INDEX FOR THE WO

TEXT THE OBJECTS ARE PROCESSED SERIALLY THE FIRST OF THE OBJECTS BECOMES THE RE
PRESENTATIVE THE APPROPRIATE INVERTED INDEX WILL BE THE OBJECTS ARE PROCESSED
SERIALLY FIRST OR BECOMES REPRESENTATIVE
 
D30
 
ANOTHER WAY OF ENHANCING AN INVERTED FILE SYSTEM IS TO INCLUDE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL TERMS
IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SPECIAL USAGE PATTERNS EXIST FOR THE WORDS
INCLUDED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXTS IN CERTAIN SUBJECT SPECIALTIES
IN PARTICULAR THE FREQUENCY OF USE OF A GIVEN TERM MAY CORRELATE WITH
SOME INDICATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT TERM IN THE GIVEN SUBJECT
AREA IF WORD FREQUENCY INFORMATION IS TO BE USED IN RETRIEVAL IT MUST
BE STORED IN THE SYSTEM AND THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
INCLUDE THE INFORMATION IN THE INVERTED FILE IN MANY SYSTEM POSTING
INFORMATION IS KEPT IN THE INVERTED FILE FOR EACH TERM THAT IS THE
INVERTED FILE INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS
IN WHICH A GIVEN TERM OCCURS THIS FREQUENCY INFORMATION IS REFERRED
TO AS THE NUMBER OF POSTINGS FOR THE TERM IN THIS WAY THE USER CAN
QUICKLY ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE RETRIEVED BY
USING A GIVEN TERM FOR INSTANCE THE TERM INFORMATION HAS POSTINGS IN
THE ERIC DATA BASE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DIALOG SYSTEM AT THE TIME
THIS BEING WRITTEN A QUERY WHICH INCLUDES ONLY THIS SINGLE TERM WOULD
THEREFORE RETRIEVE DOCUMENTS THE DIALOG SYSTEM IS A PRODUCT OF
LOCKHEED INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF PALO ALTO CALIFORNIA IN MAY SOME
INDIVIDUAL DATA BASES WERE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DIALOG SYSTEM THE
DIALOG SYSTEM IS BASED ON AN INVERTED FILE DESIGN THE SYSTEM CREATES
SETS OF DOCUMENT REFERENCE NUMBERS BY MEANS OF A SELECT COMMAND THUS
THE SELECT INFORMATION COMMAND CREATES A SET OF DOCUMENT REFERENCE
NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM INFORMATION THE SYSTEM PROVIDES
THE USER WITH A SET NUMBER IDENTIFYING THESE DOCUMENT REFERENCE
NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE THE STATEMENT GIVEN EARLIER WOULD BE ASSIGNED
SET NUMER ONE IF IT WERE THE FIRST SELECT COMMAND ISSUED BY THE
SEARCHER A SECOND COMMAND SELECT RETRIEVAL WOULD THEREFORE CREATE
SET NUMBER TWO THESE SETS MAY THEN BE PROCESSED BY A COMBINE
STATEMENT WHICH ALLOWS THE USE OF THE BOOLEAN OPERATORS AND OR OR
NOT THUS THE STATEMENTS COMBINE ONE AND TWO  ARE USED TO FORM THE
QUERY STATEMENT

RETRIEVAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS OFTEN MEASURED BY USING RECALL AND PRECISION
VALUES WHERE RECALL MEASURES THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO RETRIEVE USEFUL
DOCUMENTS WHILE PRECISION CONVERSELY MEASURES THE ABILITY TO REJECT USELESS
MATERIALS A HIGH LEVEL OF INDEXING EXHAUSTIVELY TENDS TO ENSURE HIGH RECALL BY
MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO RETRIEVE MOST POTENTIALLY RELEVANT ITEMS AT THE SAME
TIME PRECISION MAY SUFFER BECAUSE SOME MARIGINALLY RELEVANT ITEMS ARE LIKELY
TO BE RETRIEVED ALSO WHEN MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREAS ARE COVERED BY THE
INDEX TERMS WHEN HIGHLY SPECIFIC INDEX TERMS ARE USED THE PRECISION IS
EXPECTED TO BE HIGH SINCE MOST RETRIEVED ITEMS MAY BE EXPECTED TO BE RELEVANT
THE CONVERSE IS TRUE WHEN VERY BROAD OR GENERAL TERMS ARE USED FOR INDEXING
PURPOSES BECAUSE BROAD TERMS WILL NOT DISTINGUISH THE MARGINAL ITEMS FROM THE
TRULY RELEVANT ONES THUS TO OBTAIN HIGH RECALL AN EXHAUSTIVE INDEXING IS
USEFUL IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN INDEXING LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDES A VARIETY
OF APPROACHES TO COVER THE GIVEN SUBJECT AREA TO INSURE HIGH PRECISION A
HIGHLY SPECIFIC INDEXING LANGUAGE SHOULD BE USED AND THE TERMS SHOULD CARRY
ADDITIONAL CONTENT INDICATIONS SUCH AS TERM WEIGHTS AND RELATION INDICATIONS
TO OTHER TERMS ASSUMING THAT THE INDEXING IS PERFORMED MANUALLY BY TRAINED
PERSONS THE VARIABLES AFFECTING THE INDEXING OPERATION RELATE NOT ONLY TO
THE EXHAUSTIVITY OF THE INDEXING AND THE SPECIFICITY OF THE ASSIGNED TERMS
BUT ALSO TO THE ACCURACY OF THE ASSIGNED TERMS THE FORMULATION OF MEANINGFUL
BOOLEAN STATEMENTS IS A COMPLICATED TASK
 
D25
 
NORMALLY THE SEARCHER HAS TO RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF ITEMS RETRIEVED
BY A SEARCH TO FEWER DOCUMENTS THAN ARE FOUND BY A SINGLE TERM  FOR
INSTANCE THE TERMS INFORMATION AND RETRIEVAL MAY BE SEPARATELY INCLUDED
IN THE INVERTED INDEX THE PERSON SEARCHING FOR REFERENCES TO THE CONCEP
INFORMATION RETRIVAL WOULD LIKE TO ENSURE THAT THE RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS
ARE AT LEAST IDENTIFIED BY BOTH TERMS THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT DOCUMENTS
THAT INCLUDE BOTH TERMS MAY IN FACT BE ABOUT THE TOPIC INFORMATION
RETRIVAL  THE SIMILAR FUNCTION OF CHAPTER 1 IS THEN INTERPRETED AS
REQUIRING THE PRESENCE OF BOTH QUERY TERMS TO SELECT A GIVEN DOCUMENT AS
POTENTIALLY USEFUL TO IDENTIFY THOSE DOCUMENT CONTAINING BOTH THE TERM
INFORMATION AND THE TERM RETRIVAL IT IS NECESSARY TO PROCESS ONLY THE
INFORMATION FROM THE INVERTED INDEX RATHER THAN THE INFORMATION FROM THE
DOCUMENT FILE BOOLEAN LOGIC IS USED TO CONSTRUCT QUERIES CONSISTING OF
A VARIETY OF TERMS USING THE BOOLEAN OPERATORS AND OR AND NOT THESE
OPERATIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED BY USING SET INTERSECTION SET UNION AND SET
DIFFERENCE PROCEDURES RESPECTIVELY ONE QUERY WHICH MAY BE USED TO
IDENTIFY DOCUMENT ON INFORMATION RETRIEVAL MAY BE STATED AS INFORMATION
AND RETRIEVAL THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE MIGHT THEN BE USED TO FIND THE
CORRESPONDING DOCUMENT
 
 
D75
 
TERM DELETION METHODS MUST BE USED WITH CAUTION BECAUSE THE REMOVAL OF
SOME BROAD HIGH FREQUENCY TERMS MAY PRODUCE UNWANTED RECALL LOSSES 
WHEREAS DELETION OF CERTAIN LOW FREQUENCY TERMS REDUCES INDEXING
EXHAUSTIVITY AND MAY RESULT IN REDUCED RETRIEVAL RECALL AND PRECISION
INSTEAD OF DELETION THE POOR DISCRIMINATORS IT MAY BE PREFERABLE TO
IMPROVE SUCH TERMS BY TURNING THEM INTO TERM WITH BETTER DISCRIMINATION
PROPERTIES THIS CAN BE DONE IN VARIOUS WAYS BY USING CONTEXT AND TERM
ASSOCIATIONS AS EXPLAINED IN THE NEXT SECTION
IT WAS SEEN EARLIER THAT SOME WORDS OR WORD STEMS EXTRACTED FROM
DOCUMENT TEXTS MAY NOT FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY AS INDEX TERMS THIS
IS THE CASE NOTABLE FOR VERY HIGH FREQUENCY TERMS THAT OCCUR IN A
LARGE PROPORTION OF THE DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION AND FOR VERY
LOW FREQUENCY WORDS WHICH OCCUR VERY RARELY THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
SUCH TERMS CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO DIFFERERNT TYPES OF ENTITIES THAT
PROVE MORE DISCRIMINATING AND BETTER ABLE TO REFLECT DOCUMENT CONTENT  
THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROVIDES A VARIETY OF DEVICES FOR CHANGING THE
SPECIFICITY AND SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL TERMS FOR EXAMPLE THE PHRASE
TERM SPECIFICITY HAS A NARROWER  MORE SPECIFIC INTERPRETATION THAN
EITHER TERM OR SPECIFICITY ALONE SIMILARY THE TERM COMPUTER
HAS A BROADER MEANING THAN MINICOMPUTER IN THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION
SEVERAL TOOLS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED THAT MAY BE USEFUL FOR CONTROLLING OR
CHANGING THE SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL WORDS OR TERMS THUS A VARIETY OF
DICTIONARIES MAY BE AVAILABLE IN CONVENTIONAL INDEXING SITUTIONS WHICH
ALLOW THE MANUAL INDEXER TO CHOOSE BROADER OR NARROWER OR RELATED TERMS
IN ADDITION TO OR INSTEAD OF AN INITIALLY AVAILABLE DICTIONARY ENTRY
A TERM BROADENING STEP WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BASIC TERM EXTRACTION
METHODS EXAMINED IN THE PRECEDING SECTION IN THE FORM OF A WORD STEMMING
PROCESS THE STEMMING PROCESS REPLACES A FULL TEXT WORD BY A WORD STEM
WITH A BROADER INTERPRETATION
 
D777
 
HAND THE PRECISION MAY BE IMPROVED BY USING SPECIFIC TERMS OR BY USING TERMS IN
COMBINATION WITH EACH OTHER TERMS OF HIGH SPECIFICITY CAN BE IDENTIFIED SIMPLY
BY THEIR CONCENTRATION IN A FEW DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION AS DESCRIBED EARLIER
TO GENERATE COMBINATIONS OF TERMS PHRASES ONE USES TWO OR MORE TERMS SAY TERM
AND TERM WITH PARTICULAR OCCURENCE PROPERTIES AND REPLACES THEM BY A PHRASE
PHRASE FOR EXAMPLE COMPUTER AND PROGRAM MAY BE REPLACED BY COMPUTER PROGRAM OR
COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ONE EXPECTS THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURENCE OF PHRASE IN THE
DOCUMENT COLLECTION TO BE SMALLER THAN THAT OF TERM OR TERM FURTHERMORE THE
PHRASE TERM WILL HAVE A MORE SPECIFIC INTERPRETATION THAN THE INDIVIDUAL
PHRASE COMPONENTS VARIOUS PHRASE GENERATION METHODS ARE POSSIBLE INCLUDING THE
USE OF SYNTACTIC LANGUAGE ANALYSIS THESE METHODS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY PHRASES
WHOSE COMPONENTS EXHIBIT ACCEPTABLE SYNTACTIC RELATIONSHIPS HOWEVER CONSIDER
FIRST A PHRASE GENERATION PROCESS BASED ON FREQUENCY CONSIDERATIONS LIKE THOSE
USED EARLIER TO GENERATE INDIVIDUAL TERMS THE BEST PHRASES WORD PAIRS TRIPLES
ETC MAY INCLUDE TERMS WHOSE POINT FREQUENCY  OF OCCURENCE IN THE COLLECTION IS
LARGER THAN EXPECTED GIVEN THE FREQUENCIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL TERMS IF PAIR FREQ
IS THE TOTAL PAIR FREQUENCY IN THE COLLECTION OF TERM AND TERM AND TOTFREQ AND
TOTFREQ REPRESENT THE COLLECTION FREQUENCIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL TERMS THEN THE
COHESION OF THE TERM PAIR MAY BE DEFINED AS COHESION SIZE FACTOR PAIR FREQ
TOTFREQ TOTFREQ SIZE FACTOR REPRESENTS A FACTOR RELATED TO THE SIZE OF THE
INDEXING VOCABULARY PHRASES CAN NOW BE CHOSEN AS TERM PAIRS WITH A SUFFICIENTLY
HIGH COHESION FACTOR SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS TO UTILIZE THE PRECEDING
FORMULA IT IS NECESSARY TO CHOOSE AN APPROPRIATE CONTEXT FOR DETERMINING WHEN
TWO OR MORE TERMS CO OCCUR IN PRINCIPLE IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHOOSE A WIDE CONTEXT
BY DECLARING THAT TWO TERMS CO OCCUR WHENEVER THEY ARE INCLUDED IN A COMMON
DOCUMENT BETTER HIGHER PRECISION RESULTS MAY BE OBTAINABLE BY RESTRICTING THE
CONTEXT TO TERMS OCCURING IN THE SAME SENTENCES OF PARTICULAR DOCUMENTS OR IN
THE SAME SENTENCES BUT WITH AT MOST K WORDS OCCURING BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR IN
THE SAME SENTENCES IN ADJACENT WORD POSITIONS OR FINALLY IN THE SAME SENTENCES
IN ADJACENT WORD POSITIONS AND IN THE CORRECT WORD ORDER WHEN THE CONTEXT USED
TO DEFINE A PHRASE IS RESTRICTED THE PHRASE DETECTION PROCESS BECOMES MORE
COSTLY BECAUSE TESTS MUST BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT THE VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS ARE
OBEYED AND THIS IN TURN IMPLIES THAT WORD LOCATION INFORMATION MUST BE STORED
SPECIFYING THE POSITIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS IN THE SENTENCES FURTHERMORE
WHEN RESTRICTIONS ARE IMPOSED ON THE PHRASE FORMATION PROCESS THE NUMBER OF
PHRASES GENERATED FOR A GIVEN ITEM WILL OF COURSE DECREASEIN ADDITION TO USING
CONTEXT FOR PHRASE DEFINITION PURPOSES IT MAY ALSO BE IMPORTANT TO INVOKE
FREQUENCY RESTRICTIONS ON ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPONENTS OF EACH PHRASE AS HAS
BEEN STATED EARLIER THE PHRASE FORMATION PROCESS IS DESIGNED

TO USE THE BINARY SEARCH PROCEDURE THE FILE MUST BE ORDERED ACCORDING TO THE KE
Y VALUES AND THE RECORD SOUGHT MUST BE SPECIFIABLE BY CITING THE VALUE OF THAT
PARTICULAR KEY FOR THE EXAMPLE USED EARLIER THIS IMPLIES THAT ALL RECORD WOULD
BE RETRIEVED BY CITING ONLY THAT PARTICULAR AUTHOR NAME INSTEAD OF INITIATING T
HE SEARCH AT THE BEGINNING OR END OF THE FILE THE RECORD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE F
ILE IS EXAMINED FIRST THE KEY VALUE FOR THE MIDDLE RECORD IS THEN COMPARED WITH
 THE KEY VALUE SPECIFIED IN THE SEARCH REQUEST IF THE KEY VALUES MATCH THE MIDD
LE RECORD IS THE RECORD BEING SOUGHT HOWEVER IF THE KEY VALUES DO NOT MATCH IT
IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DESIRED KEY VALUE OCCURS BEFORE OR AFTER
THE VALUE OF THE MIDDLE ELEMENT IN THE SEQUENTIAL ORDER IF THE DESIRED KEY VALU

THE INVERTED FILE FOR TERM IDENTIFIES INFORMATION ITEMS AND FOR RETRIEVAL
IN THE EXAMPLE OF ON THE OTHER HAND ACCESSING ITEM IN THE DIRECT FILE
STRUCTURE REVEALS THAT THE ITEM IS INDEXED BY TERMS THE RELATIONSHIP OF
INVERTED AND DIRECT FILES IS EXACTLY THAT OF MATRIX TRANSPOSITION THE
ITEMS OBTAINED FROM A DRIECT FILE AS A RESULT OF A SEARCH MUST BE
PROCESSED TO DETERMUNE WHICH IF ANY ARE LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THE
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ON THE OTHER HAND THE ITEMS IDENTIFIED THROUGH AN
INVERTED FILE ACCESS ARE ALREADY KNOWN TO BE BY THE GIVEN SEARCH TERM
SUCH ITEMS ARE THEN ASSUMED TO BE OF POTENTIAL INTEREST OF COURSE THE
SEARCHER MAY WISH TO COMBINE DIFFERENT TERMS WITH EACH OTHER TO
FORMULATE A SEARCH REQUEST SUCH PROCESSES ARE DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER
DIFFERENCES IN THE FILE ORGANIZATION USED FOR RETRIEVAL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE
INTHE RETRIEVA PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE DIRECT FILE AN ACCESS TO A
PARTICULAR FORMATION ITEM REVEALS INFORMATION CONCERNING ALL THE INDEX
TERMS ASSIGNED TO THAT ITEM USING THE INVERTED FILE ONE OBTAINS NO
INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER TERMS THAT MAY BE ASSIGNED TO A GIVEN INFORMATION
ITEM UNLESS THE ITEM ITSELF IS RETRIEVED AS A SECOND EXAMPLE CONSIDER THE
EFFICIENCY OF THE SEARCH PROCESS IF ONE ASSUMES THAT INFORMATION ITEMS
ARE TO BE RETRIEVED BY CITING PARTICULAR SEARCH TERMS AMONG THE ITEM
IDENTIFIERS THEN AN ACCESS TO THE INVERTED FILE IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIES
ALL INFORMATION ITEMS TO BE RETRIEVED ON THE OTHER HAND AN ACCESS TO AN
ACCESS TO AN INFORMATION ITEM IN THE DIREC FILE SIMPLY BEGINS THE PROCESS
NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PARTICULAR ITEM SHOULD BE RETRIEVED
THAT DETERMINATION MUST BE MADE FOR EACH AND EVERY INFORMATION ITEM IN A
DIRECT FILE

FIGURE A DEPICTS A ONE DIMENSIONAL ORGANIZATION WHILE FIGURES B AND C

UNFORTUNATELY THE PHYSICAL ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION STORED IN COMPUTER
SYSTEMS IS LIMITED TO THE FEW DIMENSIONS OF THE EXISTING HARDWARE
SYSTEMS  HARDWARE DEVICES AND SOFTWARE METHODOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE THAT
MAY EFFECTIVELY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE DIMENSIONS  THESE ARE
INTRODUCED IN CHAPTER EIGHT  UP TO THIS POINT A FAIRLY DESPERATE PICTURE
HAS BEEN PRESENTED  BARRING SUBSTANTIAL LOGICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCES A SITUATION MAY SOON ARISE WHERE IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO
ISOLATE THE USEFUL ITEMS FROM THE MASS OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION  PEOPLE
MAY BE FORCED TO USE WHATEVER TURNS OUT TO BE THE MOST ACCESSIBLE AND
IGNORE THE REMAINDER  FORTUNATELY COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IS PROVIDING
INCREASED CAPABILITES FOR THE MANIPULATION OF ALL TYPES OF INFORMATION
THE TREND OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN FOR
COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES OF EVERY SORT TO DOUBLE EVERY THREE TO FOUR
YEARS  THAT IS TWICE AS MANY ITEMS CAN BE STORED IN THE SAME SPACE AS
THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO  THE EXCEPTION IS THE COST OF COMPUTING WHICH
HAS DECREASED  THUS FOR EQUIVALENT DOLLARS ONE CAN BUY TWO OR THREE
TIMES AS MUCH COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITY AS WAS AVAILABLE THREE OR FOUR
YEARS AGO  STARTLING ADVANCES HAVE BEEN REGISTERED ALSO IN THE
CAPABILITIES OF THE PHYSICAL DEVICES WHICH STORE INFORMATION  THE AMOUNT
AND TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT CAN BE RETAINED IN STORAGE HAS CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY  THE FIRST ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS WERE CAPABLE OF STORING
ONLY A FEW NUMBERS  AT THE PRESENT TIME DEVICES ARE BEING DESIGNED THAT
ARE CAPABLE OF STORING A TRILLION CHARACTERS OF INFORMATION  THE GROWTH
IN CAPACITY OF STORAGE TECHNOLOGY IS SUCH THAT ONE SHOULD SOON BE ABLE
TO STORE LIBRARY SIZED QUANTITIES OF INFORMATION IN A COST EFFECTIVE
MANNER  FOR THE STORED INFORMATION TO BE USEFUL THE INFORMATION MUST BE
DELIVERED TO POTENTIAL USERS  COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE
TELEPHONE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS DELIVERY PROCESS  UNFORTUNATELY
COMMUNICATION DEVICES ARE STILL RELATIVELY SLOW AND COSTLY AT THE PRESENT
TIME  HOWEVER NUMEROUS CHANGES ARE OCCURRING SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE THE
INTRODUCTION OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS THE USE OF OPTICAL FIBERS AS
COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS AND THE DESIGN OF SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATION
NETWORKS  IF THIS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE LARGE QUANTITIES OF
DATA SHOULD BE TRANSMITTABLE EFFICIENTLY IN THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE
IN SUMMARY THE EXISTING INFORMATION PROBLEMS APPEAR DIFFICULT TO MASTER
WITHOUT THE USE OF SOPHISTICATED METHODOLOGIES FOR STORING PROCESSING
AND TRANSMITTING INFORMATION  THE AVAILABILITY OF MODERN INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS GREATLY IMPROVED THE ACCESS TO MANY STORED
INFORMATION COLLECTIONS  HOWEVER EVEN THE CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE UNABLE TO
DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE INCREASING GROWTH OF INFORMATION

SORT THE FILE AND DISTRIBUTE ITS RECORDS AMONG BLOCKS WE MIGHT CONSIDER
FILLING EACH BLOCK TO LESS THAN ITS CAPACITY TO MAKE ROOM FOR EXPECTED
GROWTH AND AVOID LONG CHAINS OF BLOCKS IN ONE BUCKET GET ONE ADDITIONAL
BLOCK TO HEAD THE BUCKET FOR THOSE RECORDS INSERTED LATER THAT PRECEEDE
ALL RECORDS OF THE INITIAL FILE CREATE THE INDEX WITH A RECORD FOR EACH
INCLUDING THE EMPTY BLOCK AT THE FRONT THE INDEX RECORD FOR THE LATER
BLOCK HAS NO KEY JUST A POINTER FIND THE INDEX RECORD WHOSE KEY VALUE
COVERS THE DESIRED KEY VALUE IF IS LESS THAN THE FIRST KEY VALUE OF THE
INDEX FILE NOTE THAT THE SECOND INDEX RECORD HAS THE FIRST KEY VALUE
THEN THE DESIRED INDEX RECORD IS THE FIRST RECORD FOLLOW THE POINTER IN
THE SELECTED INDEX RECORD TO THE FIRST BLOCK OF THE DESIRED BUCKET
SCAN THIS BLOCK AND ANY BLOCKS OF THE BUCKET CHAINED TO IT TO FIND THE
RECORD WITH KEY THE STRATEGY TO USE HERE IS ANALOGOUS TO THAT DESCRIBED
FOR THE PREVIOUS ORGANIZATION USE THE LOOKUP PROCEDURE TO FIND THE
DESIRED BUCKET SCAN THE BLOCKS OF THE BUCKET TO FIND THE FIRST EMPTY PLACE
IF NO EMPTY SUBBLOCK EXISTS GET A NEW BLOCK AND PLACE A POINTER TO IT IN
THE HEADER OF THE LAST BLOCK OF THE BUCKET INSERT THE NEW RECORD
IN THE NEW BLOCK USE THE LOOKUP PROCEDURE TO FIND THE DESIRED RECORD
WE MIGHT CONSIDER SETTING THE FULL EMPTY BIT FOR ITS SUBBLOCK TO HOWEVER
AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION IF THERE MAY EXIST POINTERS TO THE RECORD BEING
DELETED ANOTHER DELETION STRATEGY MUST BE USED THE FULL EMPTY BIT IS
KEPT AT AND TO INDICATE REMOVAL OF THE RECORD A DELETION BIT IN THE RECORD

BY ANALOGY TO SHANNON INFORMATION MEASURE IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO DEFINE
THE NOISE OF AN INDEX TERM FOR A COLLECTION OF DOCUMENTS
THIS MEASURE OF NOISE VARIES INVERSELY WITH THE CONCENTRATION OF A TERM IN
THE DOCUMENT COLLECTION THAT IS FOR PERFECTLY EVEN DISTRIBUTIONS WHEN A TERM
OCCURS AN IDENTICAL NUMBER OF TIMES IN EVERY DOCUMENT OF THE COLLECTION THE
NOISE IS MAXIMIZED  FOR EXAMPLE IF OCCURS EXACTLY ONCE IN EACH DOCUMENT
ON THE OTHER HAND FOR PERFECTLY CONCENTRATED DISTRIBUTIONS WHEN A TERM
APPEARS IN ONLY ONE DOCUMENT WITH FREQUENCY THE NOISE IS ZERO
BECAUSE IN THAT CASE
A RELATION CLEARLY EXISTS BETWEEN NOISE AND TERM SPECIFICITY  BECAUSE
BROAD NONSPECIFIC TERMS TEND TO HAVE MORE EVEN DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS THE
DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION AND HENCE HIGH NOISE  AN INVERSE FUNCTION OF
THE NOISE MIGHT THEN BE USED AS A POSSIBLE FUNCTION OF TERM VALUE
ONE SUCH FUNCTION KNOWN AS THE SIGNAL OF TERM IS DEFINED AS FOLLOWS
FOR THE MAXIMUM NOISE CASE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WHERE EACH IS
EQUAL TO THE SIGNAL IS EQUAL TO SINCE IN THAT CASE EQUALS
ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN A TERM OCCURS IN ONLY ONE DOCUMENT A MAXIMUM
SIGNAL OF IS OBTAINED
IN PRINCIPLE IT IS POSSIBLE TO RANK THE INDEX WORDS EXTRACTED FROM THE
DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION IN DECREASING ORDER OF THE SIGNAL VALUE  SUCH AN
ORDERING FAVORS TERMS THAT DISTINGUISH ONE OR TWO SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS THE ONES
IN WHICH THE HIGH SIGNAL TERM EXCLUSIVELY OCCURS FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE
COLLECTION  ALTERNATIVELY THE IMPORTANCE OR WEIGHT OF TERM IN DOCUMENT CAN
BE COMPUTED AS A COMPOSITE FUNCTION TAKING INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL AS
A POSSIBLE MEASURE OF THIS TYPE ANALOGOUS TO THE TERM WEIGHTING
FUNCTION OF EXPRESSION IS
IT WILL BE SEEN LATER THAT THE SIGNAL VALUE DOES NOT GIVE OPTIMAL
PERFORMANCE IN A RETRIEVAL ENVIRONMENT
 
D70
 
THE TERM DISCRIMINATION VALUE OF EXPRESSION EIGHT CAN BE USED TO
COMPUTE AN IMPORTANCE FACTOR OR WEIGHT FOR EACH TERM IN EACH
DOCUMENT OF A COLLECTION BY COMBINING THE TERM FREQUENCY FACTOR WITH THE
DISCRIMINATION VALUE THIS PRODUCES A WEIGHTING EXPRESSION FOR TERM K IN
DOCUMENT I ANALOGOUS TO EXPRESSIONS TWO AND SIX FOR THE INVERSE
DOCUMENT FREQUENCIES AND THE SIGNAL VALUES AS FOLLOWS THE INSIGHTS
CONCERNING THE TERM OCCURRENCE FREQUENCIES ARE INCORPORATED INTO A
SIMPLE AUTOMATIC INDEXING PROCESS DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION
A SIMPLE AUTOMATIC INDEXING PROCESS IT MAY BE OF INTEREST BRIEFLY TO
DESCRIBE A SIMPLE PROCESS FOR THE AUTOMATIC ASSIGNMENT OF INDEX TERMS
TO THE DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION SUCH A PROCESS MUST START WITH THE
IDENTIFICATION OF ALL THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS THAT CONSTITUTE THE
DOCUMENTS A PROBLEM ARISING IN THIS CONNECTION IS THE DEFINITION OF
THE DOCUMENT TO BE USED THERE ARE MANY SO CALLED FULL TEXT RETRIEVAL
SYSTEMS WHERE THE FULL TEXT OF THE DOCUMENTS IS USED FOR INDEXING
PURPOSES THIS IS TRUE IN SPECIALIZED AREAS OF DISCOURSE FOR EXAMPLE
LAW OR MEDICINE WHERE THE VOCABULARY MAY BE SPECIALIZED AND THE
PRESENCE OF A PARTICULAR TERM SAY TORT IN A LEGAL DOCUMENT HAS
SPECIFIC CONNOTATIONS HOWEVER THE COMPUTER STORAGE OF THE FULL TEXT
OF DOCUMENTS IS EXPENSIVE AND IS RARELY POSSIBLE EXCEPT AS A BY
PRODUCT OF AUTOMATIC TYPESETTING OPERATIONS FOR MANY PRACTICAL PURPOSES
IT IS SUFFICIENT TO USE DOCUMENT EXCERPTS FOR ANALYSIS SUCH AS THE
TITLES AND ABSTRACTS THE AVAILABLE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE INDICATES
THAT THE USE OF ABSTRACTS IN ADDITION TO TITLES BRINGS SUBSTANTIAL
ADVANTAGES IN RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS HOWEVER THE ADDITIONAL UTILIZATION
OF THE FULL TEXTS OF THE DOCUMENTS APPEARS TO PRODUCE VERY LITTLE
IMPROVEMENT OVER TITLES AND ABSTRACTS ALONE IN MOST SUBJECT AREAS
FOLLOWING THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE WORDS OCCURRING IN THE DOCUMENT
TEXTS OR ABSTRACTS THE HIGH FREQUENCY FUNCTION WORDS NEED TO BE
ELIMINATED THESE COMPRISE FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TEXT WORDS
AND AS SUGGESTED EARLIER THESE OWRDS ARE POOR DISCRIMINATORS AND
CANNOT POSSIBLY BE USED BY THEMSELVES TO IDENTIFY DOCUMENT CONTENT
IN ENGLISH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY COMMON WORDS ARE INVOLVED AND IT
IS EASY TO INCLUDE THEM IN A DICTIONARY SOMETIMES CALLED A NEGATIVE
DICTIONARY OR STOP LIST AN EXCERPT FROM A TYPICAL STOP LIST IS SHOWN
IN TABLE THREE DASH SIX THE NEXT STEP FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF STOP WORDS
IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF GOOD INDEX TERMS AND THEIR ASSIGNMENT TO THE
DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION IT IS USEFUL FIRST TO REMOVE WORD SUFFIXES
AND POSSIBLY ALSO PREFIXES THEREBY REDUCING THE ORIGINAL WORDS TO
WORD STEM FORM THIS REDUCES A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FORMS SUCH AS
ANALYSIS ANALYZING ANALYZER ANALYZED AND ANALYSING TO A COMMON WORD
STEM THE WORD STEM WILL HAVE A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE IN THE
DOCUMENT TEXTS THAN ANY OF THE VARIANT FORMS
HAND THE PRECISION MAY BE IMPROVED BY USING SPECIFIC TERMS OR BY USING TERMS IN
COMBINATION WITH EACH OTHER TERMS OF HIGH SPECIFICITY CAN BE IDENTIFIED SIMPLY
 
D666
 
BY THEIR CONCENTRATION IN A FEW DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION AS DESCRIBED EARLIER
TO GENERATE COMBINATIONS OF TERMS PHRASES ONE USES TWO OR MORE TERMS SAY TERM
AND TERM WITH PARTICULAR OCCURENCE PROPERTIES AND REPLACES THEM BY A PHRASE
PHRASE FOR EXAMPLE COMPUTER AND PROGRAM MAY BE REPLACED BY COMPUTER PROGRAM OR
COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ONE EXPECTS THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURENCE OF PHRASE IN THE
DOCUMENT COLLECTION TO BE SMALLER THAN THAT OF TERM OR TERM FURTHERMORE THE
PHRASE TERM WILL HAVE A MORE SPECIFIC INTERPRETATION THAN THE INDIVIDUAL

LARGER THAN EXPECTED GIVEN THE FREQUENCIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL TERMS IF PAIR FREQ
IS THE TOTAL PAIR FREQUENCY IN THE COLLECTION OF TERM AND TERM AND TOTFREQ AND

COHESION OF THE TERM PAIR MAY BE DEFINED AS COHESION SIZE FACTOR PAIR FREQ
TOTFREQ TOTFREQ SIZE FACTOR REPRESENTS A FACTOR RELATED TO THE SIZE OF THE

HIGH COHESION FACTOR SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS TO UTILIZE THE PRECEDING
FORMULA IT IS NECESSARY TO CHOOSE AN APPROPRIATE CONTEXT FOR DETERMINING WHEN
TWO OR MORE TERMS CO OCCUR IN PRINCIPLE IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHOOSE A WIDE CONTEXT
BY DECLARING THAT TWO TERMS CO OCCUR WHENEVER THEY ARE INCLUDED IN A COMMON

CONTEXT TO TERMS OCCURING IN THE SAME SENTENCES OF PARTICULAR DOCUMENTS OR IN
THE SAME SENTENCES BUT WITH AT MOST K WORDS OCCURING BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR IN

D60
 
THAT IS THE FREQUENCY OF A GIVEN WORD MULTIPLIED BY THE RANK ORDER OF
THAT WORD WILL BE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE FREQUENCY OF ANOTHER WORD
MULTIPLIED BY ITS RANK THE LAW HAS BEEN EXPLAINED BY CITING A GENERAL
PRINCIPLE OF LEAST EFFORT WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR A SPEAKER OR WRITER
OF A LANGUAGE TO REPEAT CERTAIN WORDS INSTEAD OF COINING NEW AND
DIFFERENT WORDS THE LEAST EFFORT PRINCIPLE ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT
THAT THE MOST FREQUENT WORDS THOSE WITH THE LOWEST RANKS TEND TO BE SHORT
FUNCTION WORDS AND OF BUT THE WHICH ARE EASY TO COIN AND WHOSE COST OF
USAGE IS SMALL THE LAW HAS BEEN VERIFIED MANY TIMES USING TEXT MATERIALS
IN DIFFERENT AREAS
A SHORT ILLUSTRATION IS CONTAINED IN TABLE A TYPICAL GRAPH SHOWING THE
CUMULATIVE FRACTION OF WORD USAGE IN NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXTS IS SHOWN IN
IT MAY BE SEEN FROM THE FIGURE THAT THE MOST FREQUENT PERCENT OF THE
TEXT WORDS ACCOUNT FOR SOME PERCENT OF TERM USAGE USING THE ZIPFS LAW OF
EXPRESSION AS A STARTING POINT IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO DERIVE WORD
SIGNIFICANCE FACTORS BASED ON THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF
INDIVIDUAL WORDS IN DOCUMENT TEXTS AN EARLY PROPOSAL WAS BASED ON THE
FOLLOWING GENERAL CONDITION
 
NXS4
 
IN MANY RETRIEVAL INVIRONMENTS IT IS CUSTOMARY TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
THE RETRIEVAL BY USING TWO PARAMETERS FOR EACH SEARCH KNOWN RESPECTIVELY AS
RECALL AND PRECISION RECAL MEASURES THE PROPORTION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION
ACTUALLY RETRIEVED IN RESPONSE TO A SEARCH THAT IS THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT ITEMS
ACTUALLY OBTAINED DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF RELEVANT ITEMS CONTAINED IN
THE COLLECTION WHEREAS PRECISION MEASURES THE PROPORTION OF RETRIEVED ITEMS
ACTUALLY RELEVANT THAT IS THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT ITEMS ACTUALLY OBTAINED
DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF RETRIEVED ITEMS THE EVALUATION MEASURES ARE
EXAMINED IN MORE DETAILED IN CHAPTER THE USE OF EXHAUSING INDEXING AND A
SPECIFIC INDEXING LANGUAGE IS BEILIVED TO LEAD TO HIGH RECALL AS WELL AS HIGH
PRECISION THE DUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EXHAUSTIVITY AND SPECIFICITY ARE SOMETIME
 SUBSUMED UNDER THE NOTIONS OF DEEP AND SHALLOW INDEXING DEEP INDEXING IMPLIES
BOTH HIGH AND GOOD RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE SHALLOW INDEXING ON THE OTHER HAND
IS PRODUCED BY USING A FEW BROAD TERMS
 
 
 
NXS3
 
OCCURANCE IN THE DOCUMENT OF THE COLLECTION BECAUSE COMPUTER IS LIKELY TO OCCU
R IN EVERY COLLECTION ITEM AND CAN NOT THEREFORE BE USED TO DISTINGUISH THE
ITEMS FROM EACH OTHER THIS SUGGEST THAT THE USE OF RELATIVE FREQUENCY MEASURES
TO IDENTIFY TERMS ACCORDING TO SUBSTANTIAL FREQUENCIES IN SOME INDIVIDUAL
DOCUMENTS OF THE COLLECTION BUT WITH THE RELATIVLY LOW OVERALL COLLECTION
FREQUENCY SUCH TERMS MAY THEN HELP IN RETRIEVING THE ITEMS TO WHICH THEY ARE
ASSIGNED WHILE ALSO DISTINGUISHING THEM THEN FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE COLLECT
SEVERAL TERM WAITING FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM THESE BASIC CONSIDERATION
INCLUDING AN INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY FUNCTION THE SIGNAL NOISE RATIO AND
THE TERM DESCRIMINATION VALUE THESE WEIGHTING FUNCTIONS ARE BRIEFLY INTRODUCED
IN THE REMAINDER OF THE SECTION THE FIRST POSSIBILITY CONSIST OF ASSUMING THAT
THE TERM IMPORTANCE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE STANDARD OCCURANCE FREQUENCY OF
EACH TERM IN EACH DOCUMENT AND INVERSLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
DOCUMENTS TO WHICH EACH TERM IS ASSIGNED
 
 
NXS2
 
GIVEN A COLLECTION OF N DOCUMENTS CALCULATE FOR EACH DOCUMENT THE FREQUENCY
OF EACH UNIQUE TERM IN THAT DOCUMENT THIS IS THE FREQUENCY OF TERM K IN DOCUMEN
T I DETERMINE THE TOTAL COLLECTION FREQUENCY TOTFREQ FOR EACH WORD BY SUMMING
THE FREQUENCIES OF EACH UNIQUE TERM ACROSS ALL N DOCUMENTS THAT IS ARRANGE THE
WORDS ON DECREASING ORDER ACCORDING TO THEIR COLLECTION FREQUENCY ABOVE THIS
TRESHOLD VALUE AND REMOVE ALL WORDS WITH THE COLLECTION FREQUENCY ABOVE THIS
THRESHOLD THIS ELIMINATES HIGH FREQUENCY FUNCTION WORDS SUCH AS THOSE SHOWN IN
TABLE IN THE SAME WAY ELIMINATE FROM CONSIDERATION LOW FREQUENCY WORDS THAT IS
CHOOSE SOME LOW THRESHOLD AND REMOVE ALL WORDS WITH THE COLLECTION FREQUENCY
BELOW THE TRESHOLD THIS DELETES TERMS OCCURING SO INFREQUENTLY IN COLLECTION
THAT THEIR PRESENCE DOES NOT AFFECT THE RETTRIEVAL PERFORMANCE IN A SIGNIFICANT
 WAY THE REMAINING MEDIUM FREQUENCY WORDS ARE NOW USED FOR ASSIGNMENT TO
DOCUMENTS AS INDEX TERMS SINCE NEITHER THE HIGH NOR THE LOW FREQUENCY TERMS

COLLECTION PREFERABLY ALL THE RELAVANT ITEMS MIGHT THEN OCCURE IN ONE OR MORE
THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES ARE NOW EMERGENCY GUIDELINES TO INPUT MODE AFTER THIS
DOCUMENT CLUSTERS WHEREASE THE NONRELAVANT ITEMS WOULD BE PLACED IN SEPARATE
CLUSTERS A SITUATION OF THIS TYPE IS SHOWN IN SUCH AN IDEAL DOCUMENT SPACE
MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED BY ASSIGNNING TO THE RELAVANT DOCUMENT SET THE TERMS
UTILIZED BY THE USER POPULATION TO FORMULATE THE CORRESPONDING SEARCH REQUESTS
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT TERMS WILL BE CONSIDERED
USEFUL FOR QUERY FORMULATION PURPOSESAND EVEN IN AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS WHERE
INFORMATION CAN BE GENERATED ABOUT THE USEFULNESS ABOUT THE CERTAIN TERMS WITH
RESPECT TO CERTAIN TOPIC AREAS IT IS STILL NECESSARY TO MAKE THE SOMEWHAT
HAZARDOUS ASSUMPTION THAT ALL USERS INTERESTED IN SPECIFIED SUBJECT AREAS WOULD
 CHOOSE THE SAME QUERY TERMS TO EXPRESS THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS SIMILARLY ONE
WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME THAT ALL SUCH A USERS WOULD ACCEPT THE SAME SET OF
DOCUMENTS AS RELAVANT TO THEIR QUERIES IN PRACTICE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FIND
A SINGLE CLUSTERING WHICH IS IDEAL FOR ALL SUBJECT AREAS AND ALL USERS

TEXT PROCESSING METHODS BASED ON DETERMINATION OF TERM OR SENTENCE IMPORTANCE
HAVE BEEN USED NOT ONLY FOR INDEXING BUT ALSO FOR AUTOMATIC ABSTRACTING
PURPOSES IDEALLY GIVEN A DOCUMENT REPRESENTED AS NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXT ONE
WOULD LIKE TO CONSTRUCT A COHERENT WELL WRITTEN ABSTRACT THAT INFORMS THE
READERS OF THE CONTENTS OF THE ORIGINAL OR AT LEAAST INDICATES WHETHER THE FULL
VERSION MAY BE OF INTEREST TO THE READER IN FACT MOST PROCEDURES CARRY OUT AN
EXTRACTION PROCESS IN WHICH THE ABSTRACT IS DEFINED SIMPLY AS A SMALL SET OF
SENTENCES PULLED FROM THE ORIGINAL WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE IMPORTANT FOR
PURPOSES OF CONTENT REPRESENTATION THE EXTRACTING METHODS USED OVER THE YEARS
ALL START WITH A CALCULATION OF WORD AND SENTENCE SIGNIFICANCE SIMILAR IN
SPIRIT TO THA COMPUTATION OF THE TERM WEIGHT IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING CRITERIA FOR
THE SELECTION OF IMPORTANT TERMS MAY BE POSITIONAL INVOLVING THE TERM IN THE
DOCUMENT WHERE A PARTICULAR TERM IS LOCATED FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SUMMARY TITLE
THEY MAY BE SEMANTIC INVOLVING FRO EXAMPLE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THIS WORD OR
SENTENCE TO CERTAIN OTHER WORDS OR THEY MAY BE PRAGMATIC SUCH AS A SYSTEM WHICH
WOULD CONSIDER PROPER NAMES AS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT FURTHERMORE STATISTICAL
WEIGHTS BASED ON TERM FREQUENCY OR TERM DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS MAY BE
USED IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE CRITERIA GIVEN AN INDICATION OF TERM SIGNIFICANCE
IT IS POSSIBLE TO DEFINE THE IMPORTANCE OF A PHRASE AS A FUNCTION OF THE WEIGHT
 OF THE INDIVIDUAL TERMS AND OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SIGNIFICANT PHRASE
COMPONENTS THE NUMBER OF WORDS BETWEEN THEM
 
 
FMP3
 
TO UTILIZE THE PRECEDING FORMULA IT IS NECESSARY TO CHOOSE AN APPROPRIATE
CONTEXT FOR DETERMINING WHEN TWO OR MORE ITEMS CAN COOCCUR IN PRINCIPLE IT IS
POSSIBLE TO CHOOSE A WIDE CONTEXT BY DECLARING THAT TWO TERMS COOCCUR WHENEVER
THEY ARE INCLUDED IN A COMMON DOCUMENT BETTER HIGHER PRECISION RESULTS MAY BE
OBTAINABLE BY RESTRICTING THE CONTEXT TO TERMS OCCURRING IN THE SAME SENTENCES
OF PARTICULAR DOCUMENTS OR IN THE SAME SENTENCES WITH AT MOST WORDS OCCURRING
BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR IN THE SAME SENTENCES IN ADJACENT WORD POSITIONS AND IN
THE CORRECT WORD ORDER WHEN THE CONTEXT USED TO DEFINE A PHRASE IS RESTRICTED
THE PHRASE DETECTION BECOMES MORE COSTLY BECAUSE TESTS MUST BE MADE TO ENSURE
THAT THE VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS ARE OBEYED AND THIS IN TURN IMPLIES THAT WORD
LOCATION INFORMATION MUST BE STORED SPECIFYING THE POSITIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
WORDS IN THE SENTENCES FURTHERMORE WHEN RESTRICTIONS ON THE PHRASE INFORMATION
PROCESS THE NUMBER OF PHRASES GENERATED FOR A GIVEN ITEM WILL OF COURSE
 DECREASE IN ADDITION TO USING CONTEXT PHRASE DEFINITION PURPOSES IT MAY ALSO BE
IMPORTANT TO INVOKE FREQUENCY RESTRICTIONS ON ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPONENTS OF
EACH PHRASE AS HAS BEEN STATED EARLIER THE PHRASE FORMATION PROCESS IS DESIGNED
TO CREATE SPECIFIC CONTENT IDENTIFIERS TO ENHANCE PRECISION WHEN RARE TERMS
THAT ARE ALREADY SPECIFIC IN THE DOCUMENTS ARE COMBINED INTO PHRASES THE
RESULTING PHRASE TERMS MAY TURN OUT TO BE OVERSPECIFIC AND THE RETRIEVAL
RESULTS MAY DETERIORATE THEREFORE THE PHRASE INFORMATION PROCESS SHOULD BE
RESTRICTED TO INCLUDE ONLY RELATIVELY BROAD HIGHFREQUENCY COMPONENTS
 
 
FMP2
 
METHODS   ALSO EXIST FOR CONSTRUCTING A HIERARCHICAL ARRANGEMENT OF TERM CLASSES
FOR EXAMPLE BY FIRST BUILDING SMALL CLASSES CONSISTING OF A FEW TERMS
EXHIBITING SUBSTANTIAL PAIRWISE SIMILARITIES AND THEN EXPANDING THESE INITIAL
CLASSES INTO LARGE GROUPS THE NEW TERM GROUPS SUBSUME THE INITIAL CLASSES BY
ADDING NEW TERMS WHOSE SIMILARITY WITH THE OTHER TERMS ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE
CLASS IS SUCCESSIVELY WEAKER ALTERNATIVELY LARGE HETEROGENEOUS CLASSES CAN BE
BROKEN DOWN INTO SMALL MORE HOMOGENEOUS ENTITIES BY REMOVING TERMS THAT HAVE
RELATIVELY WEAK SIMILARITIES WITH THE REMAINDER SINCE THE NUMBER OF TERMS IN A
SYSTEM IS NORMALLY MUCH LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF THESAURUS CLASSES THESAURUS
CONSTRUCTION METHODS SUCH AS THE SINGLELINK AND CLIQUE METHODS WHICH DEPEND ON
THE AVAILABILITY OF ALL PAIRWISE TERM SIMILARITIES MAY BE EXPENSIVE TO
IMPLEMENT METHODS BASED ON INITIAL CLUSTER ASSIGNMENTS OF THE TERMS REQUIRE
LESS COMPUTER TIME THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THESAURUSES AND
AUTOMATICALLY CONSTRUCTED TERM ASSOCIATIONS ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING
THE RECALL PERFOMANCE PROVIDED THE ITEMS ENTERED INTO COMMON CLASSES EXHIBIT
HIGH SIMILARITIES THAT IS SIMILAR TERM TERM SHOULD BE LARGE IF TERM AND TERM
ARE ENTERED INTO A COMMON CLASS THE HIGHFREQUENCY TERMS MUST BE EXCLUDED FROM
THE THESAURUS
 
 
FMP1
 
 IT WAS SEEN EARLIER THAT SOME WORDS OR WORD STEMS EXTRACTED FROM DOCUMENT TEXTS
 MAY NOT FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY AS INDEX TERMS THIS IS THE CASE NOTABLE FOR VERY
HIGH FREQUENCY TERMS THAT OCCUR IN A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE DOCUMENTS OF A
COLLECTION AND FOR LOW FREQUENCY TERMS THAT OCCUR VERY RARELY THE QUESTION IS
WETHER SUCH TERMS CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENTITIES THAT
PROVE MORE DISCRIMINATING AND BETTER ABLE TO REFLECT THE DOCUMENT CONTENT THE
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROVIDES A VARIETY OF DEVICES FOR CHANGING THE SPECIFICITY AND
 SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL TERMS FOR EXAMPLE THE PHRASE TERM SPECIFICITY HAS A
NARROWER MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAN EITHER TERM OR SPECIFICITY ALONE
SIMILARLY THE TERM COMPUTER HAS A BROADER MEANING THAN MINICOMPUTER IN THE
PRECEDING DISCUSION SEVERAL TOOLS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED THAT MAY BE USEFUL FOR
CONTROLLING OR CHANGING THE SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL WORDS OR TERMS THUS A VARIETY
OF DICTIONARIES MAY BE AVAILABLE IN CONVENTIONAL INDEXING SITUATIONS WHICH
ALLOW THE MANUAL INDEXER TO CHOOSE BROADER OR NARROWER OR RELATED TERMS IN
ADDITION TO OR INSTEAD OF AN INITIALLY AVAILABLE DICTIONARY ENTRY A TERM
BROADENING STEP WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BASIC EXTRACTION METHODS EXAMINED IN
THE PRECEDING SECTION IN THE FORM OF A WORD STEMMING PROCESS THE STEMMING
PROCESS REPLACES A FULL TEXT WORD BY WORD STEM WITH A BROADER INTERPRETATION

THE DICTIONARY CONTAINS A RECORD FOR EVERY UNIQUE WORD INCLUDED IN THE DATA
BASE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ENTRY IS A POINTER TO A LIST IDENTIFYING EACH
OCCURRENCE OF THE PARTICULAR WORD IN THE TEXT THIS IS OF COURSE THE INVERTED
INDEX DESCRIBED EARLIER IN THIS CHAPTER THE INVERTED FILE PORTION OF THE
SYSTEM MAY ALSO BE USED TO IDENTIFY WORDS WHICH ARE SYNONYMOUS WITH A GIVEN
TERM THE SYSTEM ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY MAINTAINING A SEPARATE SYNONYM
DICTIONARY ACCESS TO AN INDIVIDUAL WORD IN THE DICTIONARY IS OBTAINED BY USING
LETTER PAIRS THAT IS THE FIRST TWO LETTERS OF ANY WORD ARE USED TO IDENTIFY A
SPECIFIC GROUPING OF TERMS WHICH IS SEARCHED IN ORDER TO FIND THE WANTED TERM
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM IS A POINTER TO THE LIST OF ASSOCIATED DOCUMENT
REFERENCE NUMBERS THE DICTIONARY HAS TWO LEVELS THE FIRST LEVEL CONTAINS THE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE LETTER PAIRS AND INDICATES WHERE THE SEARCH MUST START ON
THE SECOND LEVEL TO FIND THE WORDS BEGINNING WITH PARTICULAR LETTER PAIRS THE
SECOND LEVEL CONTAINS THE ACTUAL WORDS ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED WORD LENGTH
INFORMATION AND SYNONYM INFORMATION THUS THE DICTIONARY ITSELF IS ORGANIZED AS
AN INDEXED FILE SEE FIGURE NOTE THAT THE LOCATION INFORMATION IN THE INVERTED
FILE CONSISTS OF THREE NUMBERS TRIPLETS REPRESENTING PARAGRAPH CODE SENTENCE
NUMBER AND WORD NUMBER THIS INFORMATION IS PRESENT FOR EACH OCCURRENCE OF EACH
WORD IN THE DATA BASE
 
 
KKF3
 
A PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STAIRS AND DIALOG IS THAT A FULL STAIRS
IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDES NOT ONLY A TEXT PROCESSING AND DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL
FUNCTION BUT ALSO AN ASSOCIATED DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THE LATTER IS
DESIGNED TO PROCESS FORMATTED HIGHLY STRUCTURED INFORMATION SUCH AS NUMERIC
DATA AVAILABLE IN TABULAR FORMAT IN THE DATA MANAGEMENT CONTEXT  THE RETRIEVAL
OF RECORDS IS BASED ON THE VALUES OF PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTES OF THE RECORDS
STAIRS USES SEPARATE MODES OF OPERATION TO HANDLE TEXT AND STRUCTURED DATA
KNOWN AS THE SEARCH AND SELECT MODES RESPECTIVELY
 
 
GJK1
 
TO USE THE TEXT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE AN INVERTED FILE A
TEXT INDEX AND ONE OR MORE TEXT FILES THESE ARE ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE THE
TEXT FILE CONTAINS THE DOCUMENTS USING A SPECIAL FORMAT IN WHICH THE RETRIEVED
DOCUMENTS ARE PRESENTED TO THE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM USERS THE TEXT INDEX INCLUDES
POINTERS TO RECORDS IN THE TEXT FILE AS WELL AS PRIVACY INFORMATION AND
FORMATTED DATA ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSETS OF RECORDS IN THE TEXT FILE THESE
FORMATTED DATA INCLUDE ATTRIBUTES FOR WHICH A RANGE OF VALUES CAN BE SPECIFIED
IN ADVANCE BECAUSE THE ALLOWABLE VALUES ARE KNOWN IN ADVANCE THE MANNER IN
WHICH THE VALUES APPEAR IN THE FILES CAN BE PRESPECIFED FOR INSTANCE THE
PUBLICATION DATES MAY BE RESTRICTED TO THE FORMAT AND DATES OF THE FORM OR ANY
OTHER FORMAT WILL BE DISALLOWED
 
 
KKF2
 
WHEN WORD POSITION INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ONE CAN ALSO DETERMINE IF TWO
PARTICULAR TERMS OCCUR WITHIN A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF WORDS OF EACH OTHER IN A
TEXT THIS IS DONE BY SUBTRACTING THE LOCATION NUMBER OF THE FIRST TERM FROM
THAT OF THE SECOND ONE IF THE ORDER OF OCCURRENCE OF THE TERMS IS DEEMED
IMPORTANT ONE MAY WANT TO INSIST ON A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOCATION
NUMBERS IF THE DIFFERENCE IS ALLOWED TO BE EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE THE
ORDER OF THE TERMS IS DISREGARDED THUS SELECT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WOULD FIND
ALL DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE TERM LANGUAGE FOLLOWS THE TERM PROGRAMMING WITHIN A
DISTANCE OF UP TO FIVE WORDS TERM ORDER IS CLEARLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IF TERM
ORDER IS NOT IMPORTANT THE TERM LANGUAGE MAY EITHER PRECEDE THE TERM
PROGRAMMING BY UP TO FIVE WORDS OR IT MAY FOLLOW PROGRAMMING BY UP TO FIVE
WORDS IN THE DIALOG SYSTEM THE ORDER OF THE WORDS IS IMPORTANT AND THE SYSTEM
ASSUMES THEY ARE TO APPEAR IN THE ORDER SPECIFIED IN THE QUERY STATEMENT
 
 
GJK2
 
THE DIALOG SYSTEM ALSO USES FIELD IDENTIFICATION FOR AUTHOR CLASSIFICATION CODE
CORPORATE SOURCE DOCUMENT TYPE JOURNAL NAME LANGUAGE PUBLICATION YEAR AND
UPDATE THE LATTER FIELD INDICATES WHEN THE DOCUMENT WAS ADDED TO THE DATA
BASE SINCE SOME OF THESE FIELDS CONTAIN MEASURABLE VALUES IT IS POSSIBLE TO
INCLUDE THE CORRESPONDING VALUES IN A SEARCH STATEMENT FOR INSTANCE A RANGE OF
VALUES CAN BE SPECIFIED FOR THE PUBLICATION YEAR AS FOLLOWS
 
 
KKF1
 
THE TRUNCATION OPERATIONS CAN BE CARRIED OUT IN AN OBVIOUS MANNER USING AN
INVERTED FILE IN THE FIRST CASE TRUNCATION WITHOUT LIMITS THE INVERTED FILE
NEED ONLY BE SEARCHED FOR THE TERMS WHOSE INITIAL CHARACTERS CORRESPOND TO THE
USER INPUT USING THE PSYCH EXAMPLE THE SYSTEM NEED ONLY EXAMINE THE FIRST FIVE
CHARACTERS OF THE TERMS INCLUDED IN THE INDEX FILE IF AN EXACT MATCH IS FOUND
THE ASSOCIATED DOCUMENT REFERENCE NUMBERS ARE PLACED IN THE RETRIEVAL
CHARACTERS THAT IS AN EXACT MATCH OF CHARACTERS IS REQUIRED BETWEEN THE
CHARACTERS SUPPLIED BY THE SEARCHER AND THE CHARACTERS OF THE TERM STORED IN
THE FILE TO DETERMINE IF THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS OF THE GIVEN TERM
IN THE INDEX FILE MEETS THE CRITERION SPECIFIED BY THE USER IN ORDER TO
DETERMINE THAT THE MATCHING TERM CARRIES THE RIGHT NUMBER OF TRAILING
CHARACTERS THE CHARACTERS SPECIFIED BY THE SYMBOLS NEED NOT BE EXAMINED
INDIVIDUALLY HOWEVER CHARACTERS OCCURRING TO THE RIGHT OF THOSE SPECIFIED BY
THE SYMBOLS MUST BE CONSIDERED IF NO CHARACTERS OCCUR IN THE TERM STORED IN
THE INDEX FILE BEYOND THE LAST SYMBOL THE CORRESPONDING DOCUMENT REFERENCE
NUMBERS ARE RETRIEVED
 
 
TCO4
 
THE FIRST DISTINCTION TO BE MADE IS THAT BETWEEN MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC INDEXING
HISTORICALLY THE ANALYSIS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT MANUALLY MAYBE ONE
SHOULD SAY INTELLECTUALLY BY SUBJECT EXPERTS TO THIS DAY MANUAL INDEXING IS
THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION IN MOST OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS A VARIETY
OF AIDS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE INEXER TO CONTROL THE INDEXING PROCESS
INCLUDING TERMINOLOGY LISTS INSTRUCTION MANUALLS AND SPECIALLY STRUCTURED
WORKSHEETS TO RECORD THE INDEXING PRODUCTS SCOPE NOTES MAY ALSO BE USED TO
DEFINE THE MEAING AND INTERPRETATION OF EACH OF THE ALLOWABLE INDEX ITEMS
OBVIOUSLY LISTS OF DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE NOTES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXT FORM
ARE NOT EASILY INCORPORATED INTO AN AUTOMATIC INDEXING SYSTEM THE SECOND
DISTINCTION TO BE MADE IS THAT BETWEEN CONTROLLE AN UNCONTROLLED INDEXING
TERMS MANY EXPERTS FELL THAT AN UNCONTROLLED INDEXING VOCABULARY WHICH IN
PRINCIPLE CAN INCLUDE THE WHOLE VARIETY OF THE NATURAL LANGUAGE INTRODUCES
TOO MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBIGUITY AND ERROR HENCE A LIMITED INDEXING
LANGUAGE IS OFTEN ADVOCATED IN WHICH THE TERMS AVAILABLE FOR CONTENT
IDENTIFICATION ARE RIGIDLY CONTROLLED THIS PERMITS THE CONTROL OF SPELLING
AND THE ELIMINATION OF SYNONYMS BY REFERING TO UNIQUE ACCEPTED TERMS
FOR EACH SYNOMYN CLASS AND BY IDENTIFYING SEMANTICALLY RELATED TERMS

IT WOULD BE NICE TO THINK THAT THE CHOICE OF THE OBJECTIVE DOCUMENT IDENTIFIER
PRESENTS NO DIFFICULTIES IN FACT ELABORATE CATALOGING STANDARDS HAVE HAD TO BE
DEFINED SPCIFYING WHAT THE AUTHOR NAMES ARE ACCEPTABLE AND HOW THE AUTHOR TITLE
INFORMATIONIS TO BE ENTERED INTO THE CATABLOG THE STUDY OF EXISTING AUTHOR
CATALOGING RULES PRESENTS MANY CHALLENGES WHICH DESERVE TO BE CRITICALLY
EXAMINED IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT HOWEVER THE MOST INTERESTING PROBLEMS ARISE IN
CONNECTION WITH THE GENERATION AND STANDARDIZATION OF THE CONTENT AS OPPOSED TO
THE OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIERS THEREFORE THIS PRESENT CHAPTER IS CONCERNED WITH THE
ANALYSIS IF DOCUMENT CONTENT AND IN PARTICULAR WITH AUTOMATIC INDEXING
PROCEDURES THE ASSIGNMENT OF CONTENT IDENTIFIERS TO THE INFORMATION ITEMS IS
DESIGNED TO FULFILL THREE RELATED PURPOSES TO ALLOW THE LOCATION OF ITEMS
DELING WITH TOPICS OF INTEREST TO THE USER TO RELATE ITEMS TO EACH OTHER AND
THUS RELATE THE TOPIC AREAS BY IDENTIFYING DISTINCT ITEMS DEALING WITH SIMILAR
OR RELATED TOPIC AREAS TO PREDICT THE RELEVENCE OF INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION ITEMS
TO SPECIFICINFORMATION REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE USE OF INDEX TERMS WITH WELL
DEFINED SCOPE AND MEANING THE METHODS USED TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS DEPEND ON
THE PARTICULAR INDEXING ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE OPERATIONS TAKE PLACE
 
 
TCO2
 
IN CONVENTIONAL LIBRARIES THE CHOICE OF OBJKECTIVE DOCUMENT IDENTIFIERS IS
KNOWN AS THE AUTHOR TITLE OR DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING AS EXPLAINED IN CHAPTER
THE CONTENT DESCRIPTION OF AN ITEM CONSISTS OF A CALL NUMBER CHOSEN FROM A
HIERARCHICALLY ORGANIZED SYSTEMATIC LIST AND OF ADDITIONAL SUBJECT HEADINGS
THAT MAY BE REPRESENTED BY RELATIVELY FREE LANGUAGE WORDS AND PHRASES EACH
SUBJECT HEADING ASSIGNED TO A GIVEN ITEM MAY BE ENTERED ONTO A SEPARATE
CATALOG CARD AND THE RESULTING COLLECTION CONSISTUTES THE LIBRARY CATALOG
IN A MODERN DOCUMENT PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT THE CONVENTIONAL LIBRARY CATALOG
DOES NOT EXIST AS A PHYSICAL ENTITY RATHER THE PROFILES ARE COLLECTED INTO A
DATA BASE IN THIS CASE THE CONTENT ANALYSIS OPERATIONS ARE THEN COLLECTIVELY
KNOWN AS INDEXING WHEN THE ASSIGNMENT OF CONTENT IDENTIFIERS IS CARRIED
OUT WITH THE AID OF MODERN COMPUTING EQUIPMENT THE OPERATION BECOMES
AUTOMATIC INDEXING
 
TCO1
 
OF ALL THE PROCEDURES NORMALLY USED IN A DOCUMENT PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT THE MO
OF ALL THE PROCEDURES NORMMALLY USED IN A DOCUMENT PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT THE
MOST IMPORTANT AND ALSO THE MOST DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT ARE THE ANALYSIS RATION
OPERATIONS CONSISTING OF THE ASSIGNMENT TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC ITEMS OF TERMS OR
IDENTIFIERS CABABLE OF REPRESENTING DOCUMNET CONTENT IN PRINCIPLE A DOCUMENTANA
ANALYSIS IS REDUNDENT IF THE DOCUMENT COLLECTION IS SMALLENOUGH TO PERMIT THE
SCANNING OF THE FULL TEXT OF ALL ITEMS WHENEVER A REQURST FOR INFORMATION IS
RECIEVED
IN PRACTICE SUCH A SOLUTION IS TOO TIME CONSUMMING AND TOO EXPENSIVE HENCE IT I
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO CHARACTERIZE EACH ITEM BY ASSIGNING A SHORT DESCRIPTION OR P
PROFILE TO THE ITEM WHICH CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN ACCESS WHENEVER THE ITEM IS
WANTED IN STANDARD LIBRARY ENVIRONMENTS THE ANALYSIS OPERATIONS ARE KNOWN
VARIOUSLY AS CATALOGING CLASSIFICATION INDEXING AND ABSTRACTING THE DOCUMENT PR
PROFILE FUFILLS THE DUAL ROLE OF REPRESENTING A GIVEN DOCUMENT BY PROVIDING A
SHORT FORM DESCRIPTION AND ALSO OF DESCRIBING THE DOCUMENT CONTENT THE PROFILE
IS THEREFORE OFTEN DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS CONSISTING FIRST OF OBJECTIVE INFORMA
INFORMATION RELATING TO THE DATA EXTERNAL TO THE DOCUMENT TEXT ITSELF SUCH AS
AUTHER NAME PUBLISHER AND DATE AND PLACE OF PUBLICATION AND SECOND OF IDENTIFIE
IDENTIFIERS SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBING THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENT
 
 
MAH4
 
ANOTHER WAY TO SPEED UP A SEARCH FOR AN INFORMATION ITEM IS TO DEVELOP AN INDEX
 WHICH PROVIDES ACCESS TO SEGMENTS OF A FILE FOR INSTACE AN INDEX MAY BE CONSTR
UCTED USING THE FIRST LETTER OF THE AUTHORS LAST NAME FOR THE ORDERED SEQUENTIA
L FILE OF FIGURE ONE SEVEN THE INDEX IDENTIFIES THE LOCATION OF THE RECORDS COR
RESPONDING TO THE FIRST LETTER OF A PARTICULAR LAST NAME IN FIGURE ONE SEVEN IT
 CAN BE SEEN THAT THE AUTHORS WHOSE LAST NAME STARTS WITH THE LETTER J BEGIN TO
APPEAR AT LOCATION NUMBER K FIGURE ONE NINE SHOWS AN INDEX CONSTRUCTED FOR THE
SEQUENTIAL FILE IN FIGURE ONE SEVEN GIVEN A PARTICULAR AUTHOR NAME IT IS THEN
POSSIBLE TO USE THE INDEX TO FIND THE STORAGE LOCATION OF THE RECORDS WITH AUTH
OR NAMES BEGINING WITH A GIVEN LETTER THE SEARCH FOR A PARTICULAR RECORD NOW RE
QUIRES ONLY A SEARCH OF THE INDEX AN A SEARCH OF THAT PORTION OF THE FILE SPECI
FIED BE THE INDEX THE NUMBER OF STEPS NEEDED ON THE AVERAGE TO FIND A SPECIFIC
ITEM IS REDUCED TO THE NUMBER OF STEPS REQUIRED TO SEARXH THE INDEX PLUS N PLUS
 ONE OVER TWO ADDITIONAL STEPS FOR THE SEQUENTIAL SUBFILE WHERE N IS THE NUMBER
 OF RECORDS IN THAR SPECIFIC SEQUENTIAL SEGMENT AS AN EXAMPLE CONSIDER A SEQUEN
TIAL FILE OF ONE MILLION RECORDS A SEQUENTIAL SEARCH FOR A RECORD BEGINING WITH
 A SPECIFIED LETTER WILL REQUIRE N PLUS ONE OVER TWO OR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSANDS
AND ONE STEPS ON THE AVERAGE IF AN INDEXED FILE ARRANGEMENT IS USED INSTEAD THE
 NUMBER OF RECORDS WITH AUTHOR NAME BEGINING WITH THE SPECIFIED LEETER MAY BE
EQUAL TO FIFTY THOUSENDS THE INDEX WOULD THEN NORMALLY CONSIST OF TWENTY SIX EN
TRIES ONE FOR EACH LETTER OF THE ALPHABET THUS THE SEARCH HAS BEEN REDUCED BY A
 FACTOR ON TWENTY INDEXES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF COMPU
TER STORAGE DEVICES SUCH AS DISKS DISKS PERMIT RAPID ACCESS TO CONSECUTIVE RECO
RDS BUT ACCESS TO PARTICULAR REGIONS OF THE DISK IS SLOW AN INDEX MAY THEN BE
USED TO LOCATE THE SPECIAL REGION OF THE DISK WHICH CONTAINS THE RECORDS OF INT
EREST FOR A GIVEN QUERY THESE RECORDS CAN THEN BE SCANNED SEQUENTALLY BY
CONTRAST A BINARY SEARCH REQUIRES MULTIPLE PROBES TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FILE
UNFORTUNATELY INDEXED FILES CARRY ONE BIG DISADVANTAGE WHEN NEW RECORD MUST BE
ADDED TO AN INDEXED FILE BOTH THE FILE ITSELF AND THE INDEX MUST BE CHANGED THI
S CAN BE EXPENSINE UNDERTAKING WHICH MAY OUTWEIGH THA GAINS ACHEIVED IN THE SEA
RCH PROCESS IN ADDITION THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED DISADVANTAGES IN UPDATING AN
ORDERED FILE STILL APPLY
 
 
MAH3
 
TO USE THE BINARY SEARCH PROCEDURE THE FILE MUST BE ORDERED ACCORDING TO THE KE
Y VALUES AND THE RECORED SOUGHT MUST BE SPECIFIABLE BY CITING THE VALUE OF THE
PARTICULAR KEY FOR EXAMPLE USED EARLIER THIS IMPLIES THAT ALL RECORDS WOULD BE
RETRIEVED BU CITING ONLY THE PARTICULAR AUTHOR NAME INSTEAD OF INITIATING THE S
EARCH AT THE BEGINING OR THE END OF THE FILE THE RECORD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FI
LE IS EXAMINED FIRST THE KEY VALUE FOR THE MIDDLE RECORD IS THEN COMARED WITH
THE KEY VALUE SPECIFIED IN THE SEARCH REQUEST IF THE KEY VALUES MATCH THE MIDDL
E RECORD IS THE RECORD BEING SOUGHR HOWEVER IF THE VALUES DO NOT MATCH IT IS NE
CESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DESIRED KEY VALUE OCCURS BEFORE OR AFTER THE K
EY VALUE OF THE MIDDLE ELEMENT IN THE SEQUENTIAL ORDER IF THE DESIRED KEY VALUE
 OCCURS AFTER THE VALUE OF THE MIDDLE ELEMENT THE BEGINING HALF OF THE FILE OS
IGNORED AND THE MIDDLE ELEMENT OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FILE IS EXAMINED THIS PR
OCESS CONTINUES UNTIL THE DESIRED RECORED IS LOCATED FOR EXAMPLE IF A FILE CONS
ISTS OF SEVEN ELEMENTS WITH KEY VALUES ABCDEFG AND THE SEARCHIS MADE FOR THE RE
CORD WITH A KEY VALUE OF C THEN THE ITEMS EXAMINED IN ORDER WILL BE D THEN B
AND FILALLY C THE MIDDLE ELEMENT OF THE WHOLE FILE D IS EXAMINED FIRST ITS KEY
VALUE DOES NOT EQUAL THE DESIRED KEY VALUE C THE DESIRED ELEMENT LOGICALLY PREC
EDES THE D ELEMENT SO THE LAST HALF OF THE FILE IS IGNORED FOR THE REMAINDER OF
 THE SEARCH PROCESS THE NEXT COMPARISON IS MADE WITH RHE MIDDLE ELEMENT OF THE
FIRST PART OF THE FILE THAT IS B  THE DESIRED ELEMENT C COMES AFTER B SO THE BE
GINING PORTION OF THE FILES IS IGNORED FOR THE REST OF THE SEARCH AT THIS POINT
THE ONLY REMAINING ELEMENT IS C THE DESIRED ELEMENT THE BINARY SEARCH PROCESS
IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE EXAMPLE OF FIGURE ONE EIGHT

IN MOST INSTANCES CERTAIN PORTION OR FIELDS OF THE RECORDS STORED IN A FILE PRO
VE TO BE OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOR RETRIEVAL PURPOSES FOR INSTANCE THE NAME OF
THE FIRST AUTHOR OF A JOURNAL ARTICLE IS OFTEN USED AS THE MAIN CRITERION FOR F
INDING THAT ARTICLE THE FIELDS USED TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO THE STORED RECORDS ARE
REFERRED TO AS KEYS A GIVEN FILE MAY BE ORDERED SEQUENTIALLY ACCORDING TO THE V
ALUES OF ONE OF THE KEYS IN WHICH CASE THIS SPECIAL ORDER MAY BE USED TO OBTAIN
 ACCESS TO THE FILE FOR INSTANCE AN ORDERED FILE CONSISTING OF IOURNAL ARTICLES
MAY BE ORDERED ALPHABETICALLY ACCORDING TO THE LAST NAME OF THE FIRST AUTHOR
OF EACH ARTICLE IN CONTRAST THE LINEAR LIST WOULD STORE THE SAME IOURNAL ARTICL
ES IN NO SPECIFIABLE ORDER THE ADDITION OF A NEW ITEM TO A SEQUENTIAL FILE
REQUIRES THAT ROOM BE MADE AT THE APPROPRIATE SPOT TO ENTER THE NEW ITEM THET I
S A NEW JOURNAL ARTICLE TO BE PLACED IN THE FILE MUST APPEAR AT A SPECIFIC LOCA
TION IF THE ORDER OF THE FILE IS TO BE MAINTAINED OTHER ITEMS MAY HAVE TO BE MO
VED IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM AS SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLE OF FIGURE ONE SEVEN ON THE
OTHER HAND IN THE LINEAR LIST WHICH IS UNORDERED A NEW ITEM CAN SIMPLY BE PLACE
D IN THE NEXT AVAILABLE LOCATION TO LOCATE A SPECIFIC ITEM IN AN ORDERED
SEQUENTIAL FILE IT MAY STILL BE NECESSARY TO LOOK AT N PLUS ONE OVER TWO ITEMS
ON THE AVERAGE THAT IS ONE CAN START AT THE BEGINING OF A SEQUENTIAL FILE AND
WORK THROUGH THE FILE ITEM BY ITEM TO FIND ANY DESIRED ELEMENT HOWEVER THE EFFI
CIENCY OF SEARCH IN A SEQUENTIAL FILE CAN BE INCREASED WHEN THE FILE IS ORDERED
BY THE KEY VALUES USED IN THE SEARCH FOR EXAMPLE A BINARY SEARCH CAN REDUCE THE
 REQUIRED NUMBER OF STEPS TO LOGARITHM OF N PLUS ONE IN OTHER WORDS ASSUMING TH
AT THE FILE COTAINS ITEMS A DESIRED ITEM CAN BE FOUND IN TEN STEPS ON THE AVERA
GE USING BINARY SEARCH BUT THE SEARCH WOULD TAKE STEPS ON THE AVERAGE WITH THE
SEQUENTIAL SCANNING METHOD DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY

THE SIMPLEST FILE STRUCTURE IS REFERRED TO AS A LINEAR LIST A LINEAR LIST IS
LITERALLY AN UNORDERED COLLECTION OF ITEMS RECALL THAT CURRENT COMPUTER STORAGE
DEVICES ARE LARGELY ONE DIMENSIONAL THUS TO FIND A SPECIFIC ELEMENT IN A LINAR
LIST KEPT IN A COMPUTER STORE REQUIRES THAT THE FILE ITEMS BE EXAMINED ONE AT
A TIME THE ITEM BEING SOUGHT MAY FORTUITOUSLY BE THE FIRST ELEMENT EXAMINED OR
IF ONE IS ESPECIALLY UNLUCKY IT MAY BE THE LAST ITEM ON THE AVERAGE A SPECIFIC
ITEM WILL APPEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FILE HENCE ON THE AVERAGE N PLUS ONE OVER
2 ITEMS MUST BE EXAMINED TO LOCATE A GIVEN ITEM WHERE N REPRESENTS THE NUMBER
OF ITEMS IN THE FILE A LINEAR LIST OF THE KIND REPRESENTED IN FIGURE ONE SIX
EXHIBITS MANY ADVANTAGES FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOR EXAMPLE WHEN NEW ITEMS A
RE INTRODUCED INTO THE SYSTEM THEY CAN BE ADDED TOTHE FILE WITHOUT CONCERN
ABOUT ALTERING THE ORDER OF ALREADY EXISTING ITEMS NOR DELETIONS FROM THE FILE
BE FOLLOWED BY ANY FILE REARRANGEMENTS THE FILE MAINTENANCE PROCESS IS THEREFOR
E LARGELY ELIMINATED SINCE THE ITEMS RELEVANT TO INCOMING REQUESTS ARE UNKNOWN
IN ADVANCE IN A LINEAR LIST ARRANGEMENT ALL ITEMS MAT HAVE TO BE EXAMINED TO
DETERMINE THOSE THAT MUST EVENTUALLY BE RETRIEVED WHEN THE FILE INCLUDES ONLY A
FEW ITEMS THIS IS A REASONABLE PROCESS UNFORTINATELY FOR LARE FILES THE FILES
SCANNING OPERATION BECOMES VERY INEFFICIENT

THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS NECESSARY TO KEEP RELATED SUBJECTS
CLOSE TO EACH OTHER MUST BE DETERMINED FROM THE NUMBER OF REQUIRED
RELATIONSHIPS UNFORTUNATELY THE PHYSICAL ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION
STORED IN COMPUTER SYSTEM IS LIMITED TO THE FEW DIMENSIONS OF THE
EXISTING HARDWARE SYSTEMS HARDWARE DEVICES AND SOFTWARE METHODOLOGIES
ARE AVAILABLE THAT MAY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE DIMENSIONS
THESE ARE INTRODUCED IN NEXT CHAPTER UP TO THIS POINT A FAIRLY DESPERATE
PICTURE HAS BEEN PRESENTED  BARRING SUBSTANTIAL LOGICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCES A SITUATION MAY SOON ARISE WHERE IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO
ISOLATE THE USEFUL ITEMS FROM THE MASS OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION  PEOPLE
MAY BE FORCED TO USE WHATEVER TURNS OUT TO BE MOST ACCESSIBLE AND IGNORE

FOR EXAMPLE BOOKS ON ALGEBRA MATRIX THEORY GRAPH THEORY AND TOPOLOGY
SHOULD APPEAR CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE COLLECTION  AT FIRST GLANCE
THIS MAY APPEAR TO BE EASY ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN THESE TOPICS ALL
CLEARLY FIT UNDER THE MORE GENERAL TOPIC OF MATHEMATICS  SPECIAL
PROBLEMS DO HOWEVER ARISE FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY TOPICS SUCH AS SYSTEM
ANALYSIS  THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT IS RELATED TO SEVERAL MAJOR TOPICS
INCLUDING COMPUTER SCIENCE OPERATIONS RESEARCH ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
SCIENCE EDUCATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMSAS SHOWN IN THE SCHEME OF THE
ABOVE FIGURE  AN ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH WOULD ALLOW ITEMS ON
SYSTEMS ANALYSIS TO APPEAR CLOSE TO OTHER ITEMS IN ALL RELATED TOPIC
CLASSES CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY PLACING THE ITEMS IN ORDER ON A BOOKSHELF
WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION BASED ON ONLY ONE DIMENSION  RATHER THE
ORGANIZATION MUST BE MULTIDIMENSIONAL  A TWO DIMENSIONAL ORGANIZATION
COULD FOR EXAMPLE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SHELF LOCATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW A
GIVEN AREA RATHER THAN ONLY THOSE SITUATED ADJACENTLY ON THE SAME SHELF
 
 
MEG1
 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INFORMATION ORGANIZATION
WHICH PERMITS EFFICIENT USE OF THE INFORMATION ITEMS IS DIFFICULT
FOR AT LEAST TWO REASONS FIRST THE VOLUME OF INFORMATION EXPANDS
UNEVENLY FOR DIFFERENT TOPICS SOME AREAS SUCH AS COMPUTER SCIENCE
FOR EXAMPLE ARE GROWING AT A VERY FAST RATE WHILE OTHER SUBJECTS
SUCH AS CERTAIN FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDIES MAY NOT BE GROWING AT ALL
FUTURE GROWTH PATTERNS OF INFORMATION ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND
ANY PREDICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO LARGE ERROR RATES TO TAKE CARE OF
FUTURE GROWTH ONE MAY WANT TO PROVIDE FOR SOME EXPANSION IN EACH
AND EVERY TOPIC AREA  ULTIMATELY THESE EXPANSION MECHANISMS WILL
BE OVERTAXED IN SOME AREAS WHILE NOT BEING USED AT ALL FOR OTHER
TOPICS  A SECOND DIFFICULTY IN CREATING EFFECTIVE INFORMATION
ORGANIZATION IS THE DESIRE TO KEEP RELATED ITEM CLOSE TOGETHER

IF A MAGNETIC TAPE APPEARS SIMILAR TO A HOME RECORDING TAPE THEN A
MAGNETIC DISK RESEMBLES A PHONOGRAPH RECORD  INFORMATION IS STORED
ON A PLATTER CAPABLE OF RETAINING A MAGNETIC IMAGE  THIS PLATTER HAS
CONCENTRIC RINGS WITH INFORMATION SEQUENTIALLY STORED ON ANY ONE RING
OR TRACK  TO FIND INFORMATION ON A SINGLE PLATTER ONE NEEDS TO KNOW
WHICH TRACK TO EXAMINE AND WHERE ON THAT TRACK THE INFORMATION IS STORED
INFORMATION IS PLACED ON A MAGNETIC DISK BY MEANS OF A READ WRITE HEAD
IN MANY DISK DEVICES ONE READ WRITE HEAD IS USED PER DISK FACE THAT IS
IF INFORMATION IS KEPT IN BOTH SIDES OF THE DISK TWO READ WRITE HEADS
MAY BE USED TO LOCATE A SPECIFIC ITEM OF INFORMATION THE READ WRITE HEAD
IS MOVED TO THE APPROPRIATED TRACK AND THE INFORMATION IS READ AS IT
PASSES IN FRONT OF THE READ HEAD AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE MOVING READ WRITE
HEAD IS TO HAVE A READ WRITE HEAD FOR EVERY TRACK OF A DISK

THE BENEFITS OF THE CONVENTIONAL RETRIEVAL DESIGNS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY
UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER IN PARTICULAR WHEN THE INDEXING AND
SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE NOT CARRIED OUT CONSISTENTLY BY THE SEVERAL
INTERMEDIARIES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RETRIEVAL OPERATIONS WILL SUFFER
IF FOR EXAMPLE ONE INDEXER USES SEARCH WHEN ANOTHER USES RETRIEVAL
SOME DOCUMENTS MAY NOT BE RETRIEVED WHEN WANTED THE USE OF CONTROLLED
VOCABULARY LISTS CAN MINIMIZE THIS PROBLEM BUT CANNOT ELIMINAT IT IN
PRACTICE THE REQUIRED DEGREE OF INDEXING CONSISTENCY CANNOT BE
GUARANTEED WHEN SIMILAR INFORMATION ITEMS ARE TREATED BY DIFFERENT
INDEXERS AND SEARCHERS IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE VARIOUS DOCUMENTS
PERTAINING TO A COMMON SUBJECT AREA MAY BE IDENTIFIED VERY DIFFERENTLY
AND MANY OF THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE RETRIEVABLE WHEN WANTED THE INVERTED
DIRECTORY OF INDEX TERMS IS MOST USEFUL IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE SEARCH
VOCABULARY REMAINS STATIC OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME
 
 
ACM2
 
OF ALL THE PROCEDURES NORMALLY USED IN A DOCUMENT PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT
THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ALSO THE MOST DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT ARE THE
ANALYSIS OPERATIONS CONSISTING OF THE ASSIGNMENT TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
ITEMS OF TERMS OR IDENTIFIERS CAPABLE OF REPRESENTING DOCUMENTS CONTENT
IN PRINCIPLE A DOCUMENT ANALYSIS PROCESS IS REDUNDANT IF THE DOCUMENT
COLLECTION IS SMALL ENOUGH TO PERMIT THE SCANNING OF THE FULL TEXT OF ALL
ITEMS WHENEVER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS RECEIVED IN PRACTICE SUCH
A SOLUTION IS TOO TIME CONSUMING AND TOO EXPENSIVE  HENCE IT IS
CUSTOMARY TO CHARECTERIZE EACH ITEM BY ASSIGNING A SHORT DESCRIPTION
OR PROFILE TO THE ITEM WHICH CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN ACCESS WHENEVER THE
ITEM IS WANTED  IN STANDARD LIBRARY ENVIRONMENTS THE ANALYSIS OPERATIONS
ARE KNOWN VARIOUSLY AS CATALOGING CLASSIFICATION INDEXING AND ABSTRACTING
THE DOCUMENT PROFILE FULFILLS THE DUAL ROLE OF REPRESENTING A GIVEN

ONE MAY WANT TO QUESTION THE WISDOM OF EXAMINING LINGUISTIC PROCEDURES
IN AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL CONTEXT PARTICULARLY WHEN THE MATERIAL IN
THE EARLIER CHAPTERS MAKES IT CLEAR THAT LINGUISTIC METHODS PLAY ONLY A
MINOR ROLE IN RETRIEVAL AT THE PRESENT TIME THE FACT IS HOWEVER THAT A
LARGE PART OF THE INFORMATION STORED IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS
CONSISTS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE DATA AND THAT MANY USERS WOULD PREFER GIVEN
THE CHOICE TO APPROACH A RETRIVAL SYSTEM BY USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
FORMULATIONS OF THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS FURTHERMORE EVEN IF THE
CURRENTLY USABLE LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES APPEAR INADEQUATE FOR
FULL UTILIZATION UNDER OPERATIONAL RETRIEVAL CONDITIONS THERE IS ALWAYS
THE HOPE THAT NEW DEVELOPMENTS MAY RENDER THE LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES MORE
ATTRACTIVE IN THE FUTURE
PRECISELY WHAT DOES ONE EXPECT TO GAIN IN USING LINGUISTIC APPROACHES IN
THE RETRIEVAL CONTEXT THE MOST IMMEDIATE AIM IS SURELY THE POSSIBLE USE
OF FREE LANGUAGE FORMULATIONS BY RETRIEVAL SYSTEM USERS BOTH FOR THE
SUBMISSION OF INITIAL QUERY STATEMENTS AND FOR THE VARIOUS INTERACTIVE
PROCESSES IN WHICH QUERIES OR DOCUMENTS ARE ADJUSTED BASED ON
INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE USER POPULATION THE USE OF NATURAL
LANGUAGE SEARCH STATEMENTS COULD RAISE THE EFFICIENCY AS WELL AS THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RETRIEVAL OPERATIONS BY MAKING POSSIBLE THE
FORMULATIONS OF PRECISE REQUESTS THAT CORRECTLY REFLECT USER NEEDS AND
BY SIMPLIFYING THE USER SYSTEM INTERACTIONS

A VARIETY OF HEURISTIC PROCEDURES HAVE THUS BEEN PROPOSED FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION OF ACCEPTABLE TERM CLASIFICATIONS THESE METHODS DIFFER FROM
PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED SITUATION IN THAT CONVERGENCE OF THE PROCEDURES CAN
NORMALLY BE PROVED BUT NOT OPTIMALITY OF THE RESULT
IN THE STANDARD PSEUDOCLASSIFICATION METHOD THE CHANGES MADE TO THE TERM
CLASSIFICATION MAY LEAD TO OSCILLATIONS BECAUSE A CHANGED ONCE INTRODUCE
MAY LATER HAVE TO BE REVERSED ALTERNATIVELY SEQUENCES OF CLASSIFICATION
CHANGES MAY BE DEVELOPED WHICH ARE REPEATED INDEFINITIELY SO THAT THE
PROCESS RUNS FOREVER TO AVOID THIS POSSIBILITY ON THE SPOT GLOBAL DECISIONS CAN BE INTRODUCED
TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A GIVEN OPERATION ON THE CLASSIFICATION SHOULD BE
CARRIED OUT AT ANY GIVEN TIME THE IDEA IS TO PROCESS THE DOC QUERY PAIRS
IN SEQUENCE AND TO MAKE THE APPLICABILITY OF A GIVEN THESAURUS OPERATION
DEPENDENT ONLY ON THE DOC QUERY PAIRS PREVIOUSLY PROCESSED IN THE
CURRENT PASS FURTHERMORE THE WHOLE PROCESS MUST BE GUARANTEED TO
TERMINATE THE FOLLOWING TWO STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE
IN PRACTICE A PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE TERM CLASSIFICATIONS IS ACCEPTED IF NO
ESSENTIAL DETERIORATION IS PRODUCED FOR ANY OTHER PREVIOUSLY PROCESSED
DOCUMENT QUERY PAIR
 
 
AAO1
 
IT HAS BEEN CLAIMED THAT AUTOMATIC FREE LANGUAGE INDEXING PRODUCTS ARE
NECESSARILY INFERIOR TO MANUAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS ARE
DERIVATIVE IN THE SENSE THAT THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT AND QUERY TEXTS MUST
SERVE AS PRINCIPALE INPUTS FOR THE INDEXING OPERATION IT BECOMES NECESSARY IN
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO WRESTLE WITH THE PECULIARITIES OF THE LANGUAGES USED BY
INDIVIDUAL AUTHORS AND TO WORRY ABOUT UNUSUAL TERMINALOGIES AND EXPRESSIONS
ANY ASSERTATIONS CONCERNING THE INADEQUANCY OF AUTOMATIC INDEXING CAN ALSO BE
BOLSTERED BY DEMONSTRATIONS DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT THE RESULTS OF PARTICULAR
AUTOMATIC INDEXING PROCEDDURES WILL FAIL TO PASS ANY RATIONAL TEST CARRIED AUT
BY INDEPENDENT HUMAN OBSERVERS IN SO DOING ONE FORGETS THAT THE RESULTS OF
MANUAL INDEXING ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY THE TERMINALOGY CONTAINED IN INDIVIDUAL
DOCUMENTS NO METTER HOW MUCH CONTROL MAY BE PROVIDED BY THE AUXILIARY INDEXING
AIDS IN ANY CASE THE JUSTIFICATION OF ANY INDEXING TECHNIQUE ULTIMATELY LIES
IN THE RETRIEVAL RESULTS OBTAINED SUBSTANTIAL EVIDANCE NOW INDICATES THAT
SIMPLE AUTOMATIC INDEXING METHODS ARE FAST AND INEXPENSIVE AND PRODUCE A RECALL
AND PRECISION PERFORMANCE AT LEAST EQUIVALENT TO THAT OBTAINABLE IN MANUAL
CONTROLLED TERM ENVIRONMENTS
 
 
AAO2
 
CONSIDER NOW THE DOCUMENT INDEXING PROCESS THAT IS THE METHOD USED TO
CONSTRUCT THE DOCUMENT VECTORS THE BASIC FUNCTION OF AN INDEXING SYSTEM IS
THE SEGREGATION OF THE SUBSET OF DOCUMENTS RELEVANT TO SOME QUERY FROM THE
REMAINDER OF THE COLLECTION PREFERABLY ALL THE RELEVANT ITEMS MIGHT THEN OCCUR
IN ONE OR MORE DOCUMENT CLUSTERS WHEREAS THE NONRELEVANT ITEMS WOULD BE PLACED
IN SEPARATE CLUSTERS A SITUATION OF THIS TYPE IS SHOWN IN FIG SUCH AN IDEAL
DOCUMENT SPACE MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED BY ASSIGNING TO THE RELEVANT DOCUMENT SET
THE TERMS UTILIZED BY THE USER POPULATION TO FORMULATE THE CORRESPONDING SEARCH
REQUESTS UNFORTUNATELY IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT TERMS WILL BE
CONSIDERED USEFUL FOR QUERY FORMULATION PURPOSES AND EVEN IN INTERACTIVE
SYSYTEMS WHERE INFORMATION CAN BE GENERATED ABOUT THE USEFULLNESS OF CERTAIN
TERMS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TOPIC AREAS IT IS STILL NECESSARY TO MAKE THE
SOMEWHAT HASARDOUS ASSUMPTION THAT ALL USERS INTERESTED IN SPECIFIED SUBJECT
AREAS WOULD CHOOSE THE SAME QUERY TERMS TO EXPRESS THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS
SIMILARLY ONE WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME THAT ALL SUCH USERS WOULD ACCEPT THE SAME
SET OF DOCUMENTS AS RELEVANT TO THEIR QUERIES
 
 
AAO3
 
THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE ALSO HARD TO MEASURE USING OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS
BECAUSE THE ROLE OF THE USER IS NOT WELL DEFINED IN MANY QUERY FORMULATING
ENVIRONMENTS USERS ARE RARELY ASKED TO STATE RECALL OR PRECISION REQUIREMENTS
OR TO EVALUATE TO OUTPUT PRODUCTS YET SEARCH STRATEGIES NEED TO BE DEVISED
THAT RESPOND TO THE USERS SPECIFIC RECALL AND PRECISION REQUIREMENTS AMONG THE
CHARACTERISTICS THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN A MEASUREMENT OF SEARCH PERFORMANCE
ARE THE TYPE OF FILE ORGANIZATIONS USED THE TYPE OF QUERY DOCUMENT COMPARISON
IN USE THE EFFECT OF THE SEARCH STRATEGY ON SYSTEM RESPONSE TIME AND ON SEARCH
PERFORMANCE AND THE RELEVANCE STANDARTS OF THE SYSTEM USERS
THE FORM OF PRESENTATION OF THE OUTPUT IS THE PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF
DOCUMENTS FOUND BY THE SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO THE USERS QUERY THE APPEARANCE OF
THE OUTPUT AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF USER EFFORT NEEDED TO LOOK AT THE SEARCH RESULT
AND THE EVENTUAL SATISFACTION DERIVED FROM A SEARCH THE MORE COMPLETE THE FORM
OF THE OUTPUT THE EASIER IS THE RELEVANCE ASSESSMENT TASK FOR THE USER ON THE
ON THE OTHER HAND AS THE OUTPUT IS EXPANDED FROM SIMPLE DOCUMENT NUMBERS TO
FULL DOCUMENT TESTS THE TIME NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE SEARCH RESULTS ALSO
INCREASES
 
 
BIC4
 
THE USE OF BUFFERS AND CHANNELS WILL OF COURSE SPEED UP THE PROCESS
HOWEVER EVEN WHEN ADDITIONAL PROCESSES ARE PROVIDED FOR INCREASED
ACCESS SPEED THE PROGRAM DESIGN AND THE FORM USED TO STORE THE DATA
OFTEN DETERMINE THE SPEED OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM  IN PARTICULAR
EVEN IF THE COMPUTER SYSTEM WERE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING COMPUTATIONS
IN A FEW BILLIONTH OF A SECOND THE TRUE PROCESSING TIME WOULD BE
MUCH SLOWER IF THE MACHINE WERE FORCED TO WAIT FOR PERIODIC INPUT
FROM THE DATA BASE
A SECOND SIGNIFICANT FEATURE OF MOST COMPUTER SYSTEMS IS THE
NECESSITY OF KNOWING THE ACTUAL STORAGE LOCATION OF A GIVEN
INFORMATION ITEM BEFORE THAT ITEM CAN BE RETRIEVED  THAT IS IN ORDER
TO FIND INFORMATION RECORDS ON A PARTICULAR TOPIC THE LOCATION OF
THE CORRESPONDING INFORMATION RECORDS MUST BE KNOWN OR ELSE THE
LOCATION MUST BE DEDUCIBLE FROM AVAILABLE DATA
 
 
BIC3
 
THIS VIEWPOINT IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT IN SOME OF THE EXISTING
QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEMS DEALING WITH RESTRICTED TOPIC AREAS
A SOPHISTICATED SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS SYSTEM PROVES UNNECESSARY
SINCE THE FEW SEMANTIC PATTERNS ACCEPTED BY THESE SYSTEMS ARE
COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD AND PROCEDURES TO HANDLE THESE PATTERNS CAN
BE PROVIDED IN ADVANCE
MANY OTHER OBSERVERS PREFER THE MODULAR VIEWPOINT OF LANGUAGE
ANALYSIS  THIS USES A LARGE DICTIONARY STORING LINGUISTIC FEATURES
FOR THE WORDS IN THE LANGUAGE AND A GRAMMAR DESIGNED TO PRODUCE
A RIGOROUS ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBLE SENTENCES IN THE LANGUAGE
A SEMANTIC ANALYSIS SYSTEMS IN THEN ADDED TO TRANSFORM THE
SYNTACTIC OUTPUT INTO FORMALIZED UNITS OF MEANING
MOST PEOPLE STILL FEEL THAT A SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS SYSTEM IS
ESSENTIAL WHEN UNRESTRICTED NATURAL LANGUAGE INPUT IS PROCESSED
 
 
BIC2
 
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS OFTEN MEASURED BY USING RECALL AND
PRECISION VALUES WHERE RECALL MEASURES THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO
USEFUL DOCUMENTS WHILE PRECISION MEASURES THE ABILITY TO REJECT
USELESS MATERIALS  A HIGH LEVEL OF INDEXING EXHAUSTIVITY TENDS TO ENSURE
HIGH RECALL BY MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO RETRIEVE MOST POTENTIALLY RELEVANT
AT THE SAME TIME PRECISION MAY SUFFER BECAUSE SOME MARGINALLY RELEVANT
ARE LIKELY TO BE RETRIEVED ALSO WHEN MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREAS COVERED
BY THE INDEX TERMS  WHEN HIGHLY SPECIFIC INDEX TERMS ARE USED IT
IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGH SINCE MOST RETRIEVED ITEMS MAY BE EXPECTED TO BE
RELEVANT THE CONVERSE IS TRUE WHEN VERY BROAD OR GENERAL TERMS ARE USED
FOR INDEXING PURPOSES BECAUSE BROAD TERMS WILL NOT DISTINGUISH THE
MARGINAL TERMS FROM THE TRULY RELEVANT ONES
WHEN ONLY A SINGLE PAGE IS BROUGHT INTO STORAGE AT ANY ONE TIME
A COMPLETE DISK SEEK OPERATION IS NEEDED FOR EACH TRANSFERRED INTO
INTERNAL MEMORY

THE ORIGINAL SET OF INDEX TERMS MUST NOW BE MAPPED INTO A FINAL FRAGMENT
SET  VARIOUS METHODS SUGGEST THEMSELVES SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE THE LONGEST
MATCH ALGORITHM WHICH CHOOSES THE LONGEST FRAGMENT THAT MATCHES THE
BEGINNING LEFT HAND END OF EACH TERM  THE LONGEST FRAGMENTS MATCHING THE
LEFT END OF THE REMAINDER OF THE VARIOUS WORDS ARE THEN SUCCESSIVELY
CHOSEN UNTIL THE WHOLE TEXT IS COVERED  FOR EFFICIENCY IN THE FINAL
ENCODING IT IS CONVENIENT TO OPERATE WITH A TOTAL NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS
EQUAL APPROXIMATELY TO A POWER OF TWO  THUS EACH OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX
FRAGMENTS CAN CONVENIENTLY REPRESENTED BY AN EIGHT BIT CODE  THE FRAGMENT
ENCODING FOR SOME TYPICAL TERMS IS ILLUSTRATED IN TABLE THREE DASH TWELVE
A THESAURUS OR INVERTED INDEX GIVING ACCESS TO A FRAGMENT ENCODED
SET IS MANAGED MORE EASILY THAN A STANDARD INDEX BECAUSE A DICTIONARY OF
A FEW HUNDRED FRAGMENTS CAN REPLACE THE NORMAL LIST OF MANY THOUSAND OF
CONVENTIONAL INDEX TERMS
 
 
DVA128
 
IN PRACTICE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FIND A SINGLE CLUSTERING WHICH IS IDEAL
FOR ALL SUBJECT AREAS AND ALL USERS EVEN GIVEN FULL RELEVANCE INFORMATION
IN ADVANCE FURTHERMORE NEW DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ADDED TO THE COLLECTION
MUST NECESSARILY BE PROCESSED WITHOUT THE USE OF DOCUMENT RELEVANCE
INFORMATION THE BEST POLICY MAY THEN LEAD TO THE USE OF INDEX TERMS
CAPABLE OF DISTINGUISHING EACH PARTICULAR DOCUMENT FROM THE REMAINDER OF
THE COLLECTION THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING AS A CONTROLLING CRITERION
THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OF EACH TERM IN THE COLLECTION THAT IS THE NUMBER
OF DOCUMENTS TO WHICH A TERM IS ASSIGNED THE TERM DISCRIMINATION THEORY
EXAMINED IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER INDICATES THAT THE TERMS TO BE PREFERRED
ARE MEDIUM FREQUENCY TERMS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO A FEW DOCUMENTS BUT NOT
TO THE REST OF THE COLLECTION
 
 
DVA287
 
AN EXAMPLE MAY BE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE SECOND ARGUMENT THE LOOSEST KIND
OF SYNTACTIC CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE PHRASE COMPONENTS IS A
REQUIREMENT TO HAVE THE COMPONENTS APPEAR IN A COMMON SUBTREE OF THE
SYNTACTIC PHRASE MARKER UNFORTUNATELY EVEN SUCH A LOOSELY FORMULATED
SYNTACTIC RESTRICTION WILL CAUSE THE REJECTION OF SOME PHRASES THAT
APPEAR ESSENTIAL FOR CONTENT IDENTIFICATION CONSIDER A SENTENCE SUCH AS
EXPERTS IN LINGUISTICS MAY STUDY SENTENCE GENERATION AND ANALYSIS MOST
SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS SYSTEMS WOULD NOT PLACE THE TERMS LINGUISTICS AND
ANALYSIS INTO A COMMON SUBTREE AND HENCE THE PHRASE LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS
WOULD NOT BE ASSIGNED TO A DOCUMENT CONTAINING THAT SENTENCE EVEN THOUGH
NO OTHER PHRASE WOULD APPEAR TO BE MORE PERTINENT

WHEN ONLY A SINGLE PAGE IS BROUGHT INTO STORAGE AT ANY ONE TIME A COMPLETE
DISK SEEK OPERATION IS NEEDED FOR EACH PAGE THAT IS FOR EACH CENTROID
TRANSFERRED INTO INTERNAL MEMORY  SUCH A STRATEGY APPEARS ILL SUITED TO THE
PROCESSING OF HIERARCHICAL TREE STRUCTURES BECASUE THE NEED FOR A
PARTICULAR CENTROID VECTOR NORMALLY IMPLIES THE SIMULTANEOUS NEED FOR ITS
DESCENDANTS ON A LWER LEVEL OF THE TREE OR FOR ITS BROTHERS ON THE SAME
LEVEL OF TREE  THIS SUGGESTS THAT A COMPLETE SET OF CENTROIDS OUGHT TO BE
BROUGHT INTO INTERNAL MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME PREFERABLY CONSISTING OF
THE ORIGINALLY NEEDED CENTROID TOGETHER WITH ITS IMMEDIATE DESCENDANTS
AND POSSIBLY ITS BROTHERS  BY USING A SO CALLED PREFETCH STRATEGY THE PAGES
CONTAINING THE DESCENDANTS OR BROTHERS OF A GIVEN CENTROID CAN BE PREPARED FOR
TRANSFER WHILE THE INITIAL PAGE IS BEING SOUGHT  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
A COMPLETE DISK SEEK OPERATION IS STILL REQUIRED FOR THE INITIAL
PAGE TO BE TRANSFERRED  THE PAGES CONTAINING DESCENDANT AND BROTHER
CENTROIDS CAN HOWEVER BE TRANSFERRED AT MUCH LOWER COST AMOUNTING TO ONLY
ABOUT ONE TENTH THE TIME REQUIRED FOR A COMPLETE DISK SEEK OPERATION

MACHINES SUCH AS THAT OF FIGURE ARE NOT CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING ALL CONTEXT FREE
LANGUAGES  SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT A COLLECTION OF GRAPHS WERE AVAILABLE

CERTAIN BRANCHES WITH THE START  STATE OF SOME GRAPH  AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A
NETWORK IS GIVEN IN FIGURE  IT MAY BE SEEN THAT ONCE ARRIVED IN STATE STHE
CURRENT STATUS CAN BE SAVED AND THE GRAPH CAN BE STARTED AGAIN AT STATE
A PUSH DOWN STORE OR STACK IS USED TO STORE THE CURRENT STATUS BEFORE
PROCEEDING BACK TO THE BEGINNING STATE  A STACK USES A LAST IN FIRST OUT
DISCIPLINE VERY MUCH LIKE THE USUAL STACK OF PLATES IN A CAFETERIA LINE
THAT IS ONLY THE TOP ITEM IS ACCESSIBLE THE ONE LAST PLACED ONTO THE STACK
IN THE EXAMPLE OF FIGURE THE BRANCH IN STATE IS LABELED PUSH TO INDICATE THAT
THE CURRENT STATE IS PUSHED ONTO THE STACK BEFORE GOING BACK TO STATE UNLESS

THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT SOME WELL ESTABLISHED LINGUISTIC PROCEDURES

EXPLORED IN THE NEXT FEW SECTIONS
 
JCB334
 
IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE BASIC BINARY TREE SEARCH IS NOT EASILY
ADAPTED TO DYNAMIC FILE CONDITIONS SINCE THE FILE MUST BE MAINTAINED IN
ORDERED SEQUENCE ACCORDING TO KEY VALUES AN INSERTION OF A NEW RECORD
INTO ITS PROPER PLACE MAY CAUSE THE DISPLACEMENT OF HALF THE RECORDS IN
THE FILE FURTHERMORE THE TREE TRAVERSAL OPERATION NEEDE TO LOCATE THE
NEXT RECORD IDENTIFIER TO BE MATCHED AGAINST THE QUERY MAY BE EXPENSIVE
TO PERFORM INDEED FOR A FILE OF RECORDS THE BINARY TREE EXHIBITS LEVELS
AND HENCE DIFFERENT RECORD IDENTIFIERS MUST BE COMPARED WITH THE QUERY
KEY SINCE A NEW DISK SEEK OPERATION MAY BE NEEDED FOR EACH RECORD
IDENTIFIER THE STANDARD BINARY TREE OPERATION WILL BE EXPENSIVE TO CARRY
OUT FOR LARGE FILES
THIS SUGGEST THAT A TREE SEARCH COULD BE MORE EFFICIENT WHEN THE NUMBER
OF LEVELS IN THE SEARCH TREE IS SMALL THE HEIGHT OF THE TREE THAT IS THE
NUMBER OF TREE LEVELS CAN BE REDUCED BY PACKING MORE THAN ONE KEY VALUE
RECORD IDENTIFIER INTO EACH NODE OF THE REE FURTHERMORE SOME FILE GROWTH
CAN BE ACCOMMODATED BY LEAVING SPACE IN EACH TREE NODE FOR NEW KEY VALUES
CORRESPONDING TO NEW RECORDS ADDED TO THE FILE THE BEST KNOWN OF THE
DYNAMIC SEARCH TREES OBEYING THESE SPECIFICATIONS IS THE SO CALLED BTREE

THERE ARE TWO POTENTIAL SOURCES FOR ANY STANDARD THOSE AGREED TO BY AN OFFICIAL STANDARDS 
ORGANIZATION AND A DE FACTO STANDARD BASED UPON HIGH USAGE ACROSS A LARGE USER POPULATION   
THE STANDARDS ORGANIZATION MOST INVOLVED IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS STANDARDS IN THE UNITED

THERE ARE USUALLY TWO MAJOR DATA STRUCTURES IN ANY INFORMATION SYSTEM   ONE STRUCTURE 
STORES AND MANAGES THE RECEIVED ITEMS IN THEIR NORMALIZED FORM   THE PROCESS SUPPORTING 
THIS STRUCTURE IS CALLED THE DOCUMENT MANAGER    THE OTHER MAJOR DATA STRUCTURE CONTAINS 
THE PROCESSING TOKENS AND ASSOCIATED DATA TO SUPPORT SEARCH   FIGURE 4 1 EXPANDS THE 
DOCUMENT FILE CREATION FUNCTION IN FIGURE 1 4 FROM CHAPTER 1 SHOWING THE DOCUMENT MANAGER 
FUNCTION   DETAILS ON THE CREATION OF PROCESSING TOKENS CAN BE FOUND IN SECTION 1 3 1

WHICH ARE PASSED TO THE DOCUMENT MANAGER FOR RETRIEVAL   THIS CHAPTER FOCUSES ON DATA

IN THE COMPLETE TERM RELATION METHOD THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN EVERY TERM PAIR IS CALCULATED 
AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE CLUSTERS   THE EASIEST WAY TO UNDERSTAND THIS APPROACH IS 
TO CONSIDER THE VECTOR MODEL   THE VECTOR MODEL IS REPRESENTED BY A MATRIX WHERE THE ROWS 
ARE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS AND THE COLUMNS ARE THE UNIQUE WORDS PROCESSING TOKENS IN THE ITEMS   
THE VALUES IN THE MATRIX REPRESENT HOW STRONGLY THAT PARTICULAR WORD REPRESENTS CONCEPTS 
IN THE ITEM   FIGURE 6 2 PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF A  DATABASE WITH 5 ITEMS AND 8 TERMS TO 
DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TERMS A SIMILARITY MEASURE IS REQUIRED   THE MEASURE 
CALCULATES THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN TWO TERMS   IN CHAPTER 7 A NUMBER OF SIMILARITY MEASURES 
ARE PRESENTED

HOMOGRAPH RESOLUTION  A HOMOGRAPH IS A WORD THAT HAS MULTIPLE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MEANINGS
FOR EXAMPLE THE TERM FIELD COULD MEAN A ELECTRONIC FIELD A FIELD OF GRASS ETC  
IT IS DIFFICULT TO ELIMINATE HOMOGRAPHS BY SUPPLYING A UNIQUE MEANING FOR EVERY 
HOMOGRAPH LIMITING THE THESAURUS DOMAIN HELPS TYPICALLY THE SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR 
HOMOGRAPHS AND REQUIRES THAT THE USER INTERACT WITH THE SYSTEM TO SELECT THE 
DESIRED MEANING IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT MEANING OF THE HOMOGRAPH 
WHEN A USER ENTERS MULTIPLE SEARCH TERMS BY ANALYZING THE OTHER TERMS ENTERED HAY 
CROPS AND FIELD SUGGEST THE AGRICULTURAL MEANING FOR FIELD VOCABULARY CONSTRAINTS 
THIS INCLUDES GUIDELINES ON THE NORMALIZATION AND SPECIFICITY OF THE VOCABULARY 
NORMALIZATION MAY CONSTRAIN THE THESAURUS TO STEMS VERSUS COMPLETE WORDS SPECIFICITY 
MAY ELIMINATE  SPECIFIC WORDS OR USE GENERAL TERMS FOR CLASS IDENTIFIERS THE PREVIOUS 
DISCUSSION

VMP144

THE MANUAL CLUSTERING PROCESS FOLLOWS THE STEPS DESCRIBED IN SECTION IN THE GENERATION 
OF A THESAURUS THE FIRST STEP IS TO DETERMINE THE DOMAIN FOR THE CLUSTERING DEFINING THE 
DOMAIN ASSISTS IN REDUCING AMBIGUITIES CAUSED BY HOMOGRAPHS AND HELPS FOCUS THE CREATOR 
USUALLY EXISTING THESAURI CONCORDANCES FROM ITEMS THAT COVER THE DOMAIN AND DICTIONARIES 
ARE USED AS STARTING POINTS FOR GENERATING THE SET OF POTENTIAL WORDS TO BE INCLUDED IN 
THE NEW THESAURUS  A CONCORDANCE IS AN ALPHABETICAL LISTING OF  WORDS FROM A SET OF ITEMS 
ALONG WITH THEIR FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND REFERENCES OF WHICH ITEMS IN WHICH THEY ARE 
FOUND THE ART OF MANUAL THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION RESIDES IN THE SELECTION OF THE SET OF WORDS 
TO BE INCLUDED CARE IS TAKEN TO NOT INCLUDE WORDS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE DOMAIN OF THE 
THESAURUS OR THOSE THAT HAVE VERY HIGH FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND THUS HOLD NO INFORMATION 
VALUE EG THE TERM COMPUTER IN A THESAURUS FOCUSED ON DATA 


VMP149

THIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWS TERMS TO BE IN MULTIPLE CLUSTERS EG TERM THIS COULD BE ELIMINATED BY 
EXPANDING THE CONSTRAINTS TO EXCLUDE ANY TERM THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SELECTED FOR A PREVIOUS 
CLUSTER THE STRING TECHNIQUE STARTS WITH A TERM AND INCLUDES IN THE CLASS ONE ADDITIONAL TERM 
THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE TERM SELECTED AND NOT ALREADY IN A CLASS THE NEW TERM IS THEN USED AS 
THE NEW NODE AND THE PROCESS IS REPEATED UNTIL NO NEW TERMS CAN BE ADDED BECAUSE THE TERM BEING 
ANALYZED DOES NOT HAVE ANOTHER TERM RELATED TO IT OR THE TERMS RELATED TO IT ARE ALREADY IN THE 
CLASS A NEW CLASS IS STARTED WITH ANY TERM NOT CURRENTLY IN ANY EXISTING CLASS USING THE ADDITIONAL 
GUIDELINES TO SELECT THE LOWEST NUMBER TERM SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT TERM AND NOT TO SELECT ANY TERM 
ALREADY IN AN EXISTING CLASS PRODUCES THE FOLLOWING CLASSES

VMP151

AN ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY FOR CREATING CLUSTERS IS TO START WITH A SET OF EXISTING CLUSTERS THIS 
METHODOLOGY REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SIMILARITY CALCULATIONS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE CLUSTERS THE 
INITIAL ASSIGNMENT OF TERMS TO THE CLUSTERS IS REVISED BY REVALIDATING EVERY TERM ASSIGNMENT TO A 
CLUSTER  THE PROCESS STOPS WHEN MINIMAL MOVEMENT BETWEEN CLUSTERS IS DETECTED  TO MINIMIZE CALCULATIONS 
CENTROIDS ARE CALCULATED FOR EACH CLUSTER A CENTROID IS VIEWED IN PHYSICS AS THE CENTER OF MASS OF 
A SET OF OBJECTS  IN THE CONTEXT OF VECTORS IT WILL EQUATE TO THE AVERAGE OF ALL OF THE VECTORS IN A 
CLUSTER ONE WAY TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS IS TO VIEW THE CENTROIDS OF THE CLUSTERS AS ANOTHER POINT 
IN THE NDIMENSIONAL SPACE WHERE N IS THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF TERMS TO CLUSTERS 
PRODUCES CENTROIDS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO THE FINAL CLUSTERING OF TERMS THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN ALL 
EXISTING TERMS

VMP154

THIS TECHNIQUE HAS THE MINIMUM OVERHEAD IN THAT ONLY ONE PASS OF ALL OF THE TERMS IS USED TO ASSIGN 
TERMS TO CLASSES  THE FIRST TERM IS ASSIGNED TO THE FIRST CLASS EACH ADDITIONAL TERM IS COMPARED TO 
THE CENTROIDS OF THE  EXISTING CLASSES A THRESHOLD IS CHOSEN  IF THE ITEM IS GREATER THAN THE THRESHOLD 
IT IS ASSIGNED TO THE CLASS WITH THE HIGHEST SIMILARITY A NEW CENTROID HAS TO BE CALCULATED FOR THE 
MODIFIED CLASS  IF THE SIMILARITY TO ALL OF THE EXISTING CENTROIDS IS LESS THAN THE THRESHOLD THE 
TERM IS THE FIRST ITEM IN A NEW CLASS  THIS PROCESS CONTINUES UNTIL ALL ITEMS ARE ASSIGNED TO CLASSES 
USING THE SYSTEM DEFINED IN FIGURE WITH A THRESHOLD OF THE FOLLOWING CLASSES WOULD BE GENERATED

TIME SYNCHRONIZATION IS THE EXAMPLE OF TRANSCRIBED TEXT FROM AUDIO OR COMPOSITE VIDEO 
SOURCES POSTIONAL SYNCHRONIZATION IS WHERE THE MILTIMEDIA IS LOCALIZED BY A HYPERLINK 
IN A TEXTUAL ITEM THE SYNCHRONIZATION CAN BE USED TO INCREASE THE PRECISION OF THE 
SEARCH PROCESS ADDED RELEVANCE WEIGHTS SHOULD BE ASSIGNED WHEN THE MULTIMEDIA SEARCH 
AND THE TEXTUAL SEARCH RESULT IN HITS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE IMAGE 
OF TONY BLAIR IS FOUND IN THE SECTION OF A VIDEO WHERE THE TRANSCRIBED AUDIO IS 
DISCUSSING TONY BLAIR THEN THE HIT IS MORE LIKELY THEN WHEN EITHER EVENT OCCURS 
IDEPENDENTLYTHE SAME WOULD BE TRUE WHEN THE JPEG IMAGE HITS ON TONY BLAIR IN A TEXTUAL 
PARAGRAPH DISCUSSING HIM IN AN HTML ITEM

HLH64

INDEXING ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIMEDIA DIFFERS FROM THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS OF INDEXING 
THE AUTOMATED INDEXING TAKES PLACE IN MULTIPLE PASSWS OF THE INFORMATION VERSUS JUST 
A DIRECT CONVERSION TO THE INDEXING STRUCTURE THE FIRST PASS IN MOST CASES IS A 
CONVERSION FROM THE ANALOG INPUT MODE INTO A DIGITAL STRUCTURE THEN ALGORITHMS ARE 
APPPLIED TO THE DIGITAL STRUCTURE TO EXTRACT THE UNIT OF PROCESSING OF THE DIFFERENT 
MODALITIES THAT WILL BE USED TO REPRESENT THE ITEM IN AN ABSTARCT SENSE THIS COULD BE 
CONSIDERED THE LOCATION OF A PROCESSING TOKEN IN THE MODALITY THIS UNIT WILL UDERGO THE 
FINAL PROCESSING THAT WILL EXTRACT THE SEARCHABLE FEATURES THAT REPRESENT THE UNITE

THE CONVECTIS SYSTEM USES NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHMS AND TERMS IN A SIMILAR CONTEXT PROXIMITY 
OF OTHER TERMS AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHICH TERMS ARE RELATED AND DEFINING A PARTICULAR 
CONCEPT A TERM CAN HAVE DIFFERENT WEIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT CONCEPTS AS DESCRIBED 
THE DEFINITION OF A SIMILAR CONTEXT IS TYPICALLY DEFINED BY THE NUMBER OF NON STOP WORDS 
EPARATING THE TERMS THE FARTHER APART TERMS ARE THE LESS COUPLED THE TERMS ARE ASSOCIATED 
WITHIN A PRATICULAR CONCEPT CLASS EXISTING TERMS ALREADY HAVE A MAPPING TO CONCEPT CLASSES 
NEW TERMS CAN BE MAPPED TO EXISTING CLASSES BY APPLYING THE CONTEXT RULES TO THE CLASSES 
THAT TERMS NEAR THE NEW TERM ARE MAPPED SPECIAL RULES MUST BE APPLIED TO CREATE A NEW CONCEPT

ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERNET THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING HARDCOPY TEXT IMAGES EG
PICTURES MAPS AND ANALOG EG AUDIO VIDEO DATA AND THE STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF 
THE DIGITAL VERSION IS A MAJOR CONCERN TO DIGITAL LIBRARIES INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
SYSTEMS ARE STARTING TO EVOLVE AND INCORPORATE DIGITIZED VERSIONS OF THESE SOURCES AS 
PART OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM BUT THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF VALUE PLACED ON THE ORIGINAL
SOURCE ESPECIALLY PRINTED MATERIAL THAT IS AN ISSUE TO DIGITAL LIBRARIES AND TO A
LESSER CONCERN TO INFORMATION RETEVAL SYSTEMS OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS HOW TO CONTINUE

THE TERM DATA WAREHOUSE COMES MORE FROM THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR THAN
ACADEMIC SOURCES IT COMES FROM THE NEED FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTROL THE 
PROLIFERATION OF DIGITAL INFROMATION ENSURING THAT IT IS KNOWN AND RECOVERABLE ITS
GOAL IS TO PROVIDE TO THE DECISION MAKERS THE CRITICAL INFORMATION TO ANSWER FUTURE
DIRECTION QUESTIONS FREQUENTLY A DATA WAREHOUSE IS FOCUSED SOLELY ON STRUCTURED
DATABASES A DATA WAREHOUSE CONSISTS OF THE DATA BEGING STORED AN INPUT FUNCTION THAT
CAPTURES DATA AND MOVES IT TO THE DATA WAREHOUSE DATA SEARCH AND MANIPULATION TOOLS
THAT ALLOW USERS THE MEANS TO ACCESS AND ANALYZE THE WAREHOUSE DATA AND A DELIVERY
MECHANISM TO EXPORT DATA TO OTHER WAREHOUSES DATA MARTS SMALL WAREHOUSES OR
SUBSETS OF A LARGER WAREHOUSE AND EXTERNAL SYSTEMS
DATA WAREHOUSES ARE SIMILAR TO INFORMATION STORATE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS IN 
THAT THEY BOTH HAVE A NEED FOR SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION BUT A DATA
WAREHOUSE IS MORE FOCUSED ON STRUCTURED DATA AND DECISION SUPPORT TECHNOLOGIES IN
ADDITOIN TO THE NORMAL SEARCH PROCESS A COMPLETE SYSTEM PROVIDES A FLEXIBLE SET OF
ANALYTICAL TOOLS TO MINE THE DATA DAT MINING ORIGINALLY CALLED KNOWLEDGE
DISCOVERY IN DATABASES KDD IS A SEARCH PROCESS THAT AUTOMATICALLY ANALYZES DATA
AND EXTRACT RELATIONSHIPS AND DEPENDENCIES THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE DATABASE DESIGN
MOST OF THE RESEARCH FOCUS IS ON THE STATISTICS PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS TO DETECT THE HIDDEN RELATIONSHIPS OF DATA IN REALITY THE MOST
DIFFCULT TASK IS IN PREPROCESSING THE DATA FROM THE DATABASE FOR PROCESSING BY THE
ALGORITHMS THIS DIFFERS FROM CLUSTERING IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN THAT CLUSTERING IS
BASED UPON KNOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF ITEMS WHEREAS DATA MINING DOES NOT DEPEND
UPON KNOWN RELATIONSHIPS FOR MORE DETAIL ON DATA MINING SEE THE NOVEMBER 1996

21 SEARCH CAPABILITIES
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE SEARCH CAPABILITY IS TO ALLOW FOR A MAPPING BETWEEN A
USERS SPECIFIED NEED AND THE ITEMS IN THE INFORMATION DATABASE THAT WILL ANSWER THAT
NEED THE SEARCH QUERY STATEMENT IS THE MEANS THAT THE USER EMPLOYS TO 
COMMUNICATE A DESCRIPTION OF THE NEEDED INFORMATION TO THE SYSTEM IT CAN CONSIST OF
NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXT IN COMPOSITON STYLE AND OR QUERY TERMS REFERRED TO AS TERMS IN
THIS BOOK WITH BOOLEAN LOGIC INDICATORS BETWEEN THEM HOW THE SYSTEM TRANSLATES
THE SEARCH QUERY INTO PROCESSING STEPS TO FIND THE POTENTIAL RELEVANT ITMES IS
DESCRIBED IN LATER CHAPTERS ONE CONCEPT THAT HAS OCCASIONALLY BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN 
COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS EG RETRIEVALWARE AND HOLDS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR 
ASSISTING IN THE LOCATION AND RANKING OF RELEVANT ITEMS IS THE WEIGHTTING OF SEARCH

BOOLEAN OR NATURAL LANGUAGE INTERFACE GIVEN THE FOLLOWING NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY
STATEMENT WHERE THE IMPORTANCE OF A PARTICULAR SEARCH TERM IS INDICATED BY A VALUE IN
PARENTHISIS BETWEEN 00 AND 10 WITH 10 BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT
FIND ARTICLES THAT DISCUSS AUTOMOBILE EMISSIONS9 OR SULFUR DIOXIDE3 ON 
THE FARMING INDUSTRY
THE SYSTEM WOULD RECOGNIZE IN ITS IMPORTANCE RANKING AND ITEM SLECTION PROCESS THAT
AUTOMOBILE EMISSIONS ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITEMS DISCUSSING SULFUR DIOXIDE
PROBLEMS
THE SEARCH STATEMENT MAY APPLY TO THE COMPLETE ITEM OR CONTAIN ADDITONAL

NOT A SEMANTIC BASIS DEFINING THE CLASSES AS SUCH STATISTICAL THESAURI ARE FREQUENTLY
USED AS AUTOMATIC EXPANSIONS OF USERS SEARCHES WITHOUT THE USER DIRECTLY INTERACTING
WITH THE THESAURUS
THEORETICALLY THESAURI AND CONCEPT TREES COULD BE USED TO EITHER EXPAND A
SEARCH STATEMENT WITH ADDITIONAL TERMS OR MAKE IT MORE SPECIFIC BUT SUBSTITUTING
MORE SPECIFIC TERMS FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE EXPANDING THE TERMS INCREASES THE RECALL
OF THE SEARCH WITH A POSSIBLE DECREASE IN PRRECISION GOING TO MORE SPECIFIC TERMS
INCREASES PRECISION AND POSSIBLY REDUCE RECALL IN MOST CASES THE GENERALIZATION
PROCESS IS USED IN EXPANDING A SEARCH STATEMENT WITH MORE TERMS
218 NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERIES
RATHER THAN HAVING THE USER ENTER A SPECIFIC BOOLEAN QUERY BY SPECIFYING
SEARCH TERMS AND THE LOGIC BETWEEN THEM NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERIES ALLOW A USRE TO
ENTER A PROSE STATEMENT THAT DESCRIBES THE INFORMATION THAT THE USER WANTS TO FIND
THE LONGER THE PROSE THE MORE ACCURATE THE RESULTS RETURED THE MOST DIFFICULT
LOGIC CASE ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERIES IS THE ABILITY TO SPECIFY
NEGATION IN THE SEARCH STATEMENT AND HAVE THE SYSTEM RECOGNIZE IT AS NEGATION THE 
SYTEM SEARCHES AND FINDS THOSE ITMES MOST LIKE THE QUERY STATEMENT ENTERED THE
TECHNIQUES FOR LOCATING ITMES THAT ARE LIKE A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE SEARCH STATEMENT
FOR MANY USERS THIS TYPE OF AN INTERFACE PROVIDES A NATURAL EXTENSION TO ASKING 
SOMEONE TO PERFORM A SEARCH IN THIS CASE THE DISCOURSE IS WITH THE COMPUTER AN
EXAMPLE OF A NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY IS
FIND FOR ME ALL THE ITEMS THAT DISCUSS OIL RESERVES AND CURRENT ATTEMPST TO 
FIND NEW OIL RESERVES INCLUDE ANY ITEMS THAT DISCUSS THE INTERNATIONAL
FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE OIL PRODUCTION PROCESS DO NOT ICLUDE ITEMS ABOUT
THE OIL INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES
THE WAY A SYSTEM USES THIS INPUT FOR A SEARCH IS DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER 7 THE 
PROBLEM WITH MANY TECHNIQUES AND SYSTEMS IS TO UNDERSTAND THE NEGATION CONCEPT OF 
EXCLUDING ITEMS ABOUT THE OIL INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES
WHEN THIS CAPABILITY HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE USERS HAVE A TENDENCY TO 
ENTER SENTENCE FRAGMENTS THAT REFLECT THEIR SEARCH NEED RATHER THAN COMPLETE
SENTENCES THIS IS PREDICTABLE BECAUSE THE USERS WANT TO MINIMIZE USE OF THE HUMAN
RESOURC THEIR TIME THE LIKELY INPUT FOR THE ABOVE EXAMPLE IS
OIL RESERVES AND ATTEMPTS TO FIND NEW OIL RESERVES INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
ASPECTS OF OIL PRODUCTION NOT UNITED STATES OIL INDUSTRY

SIGNIFICANT OVERHEAD IN ADDING NEW WORDS AND INVERSION LISTS UNTIL THE FREQUENTLY

STRUCTURE AT THE START OF A NEW DATABASE THUS SAVING SIGNIFICANT OVERHEAD DURING THE

BE USED TO OPTMIZED THE RESOLUTION OF THE QUEREY BASED UPON INFORMATION MAINTAINED

THE GOAL OF A SIGNATURE FILE STRUCTURE IS TO PROVIDE A FAST TEST TO ELIMINATE THE
MAJORITY OF ITEMS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO QUERY THE ITEMS THAT SATISFY THE TEST CAN
EITHER BE EVALUATED BY ANOTHER SEARCH ALGORITHM TO ELIMINATE ADDITIONAL FALSE HITS OR
DELIVERED TO THE USER TO REVIEW THE TEXT OF THE ITEMS IS REPRESENTED IN A HIGHLY
COMPRESSED FORM THAT FACILITATES TEH FAST TEST BECAUSE FILE STRUCTURE IS HIGHLY
COMPRESSED AND UNORDERED IT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SPACE THAN AN INVERTED FILE
STRUCTURE AND NEW ITEMS CAN BE CONCATENATED TO THE END OF THE STRUCTRUE VERSUS THE
SIGNIFICANT INVERSION LIST UPDATE SINCE ITEMS ARE SELDOM DELETED FROM INFORMATION
DATA BASES IT IS TYPICAL TO LEAVE DELETED ITEMS IN PLACE AND MARK THEM AS DELETED
SIGNATURE FILE SEARCH IS A LINEAR SCAN OF THE COMPRESSED VERSION OF ITEMS PRODUCING A

AN INTERESTING SIDE EFFECT OF MAINTAINING CURRENCY IN THE DATABASE FOR TERM
WEIGHTS IS THAT THE SAME QUERY OVER TIME RETURNS A DIFFERENT ORDERING OF ITEMS
A NEW WORD IN THE DATABASE UNDERGOES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS WEIGHT STRUCTURE
FROM INITIAL INTRODUCTION UNTIL ITS FREQUENCY IN THE DATABASE REACHES A LEVEL
WHERE SMALL CHANGES DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CHANGES IN WEIGHT VALUES
ANOTHER ISSUE IS THE DESIRE TO PARTITION AN INFORMATION DATABASE BASED UPON TIME
THE VALUE OF MANY SOURCES OF INFORMATION VARY EXPONENTIALLY BASED UPON THE AGE
OF AN ITEM OLDER ITEMS HAVE LESS VALUE  THIS LEADS TO PHYSICALLY PARTITIONING
THE DATABASE BY TIME EG STARTING A NEW DATABASE EACH YEAR ALLOWING THE USER TO
SPECIFY THE TIME PERIOD TO SEARCH  THERE ARE ISSUES THEN OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE
AGGREGATE VARIABLES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FOR THE SAME PROCESSING TOKEN IN EACH

BJM12

THE BASIC ALGORITHM IS IMPROVED BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FREQUENCY OF
OCCURRENCE OF THE PROCESSING TOKEN IN THE DATABASE  ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF
INDEXING AN ITEM IS TO DISCRIMINATE THE SEMANTICS OF THAT ITEM FROM OTHER ITEMS
IN THE DATABASE  IF THE TOKEN COMPUTER OCCURS IN EVERY ITEM IN THE DATABASE ITS
VALUE REPRESENTING THE SEMANTICS OF AN ITEM MAY BE LESS USEFUL COMPARED TO A
PROCESSING TOKEN THAT OCCURS IN ONLY A SUBSET OF THE ITEMS IN THE DATABASE THE
TERM COMPUTER REPRESENTS A CONCEPT USED IN AN ITEM BUT IT DOES NOT HELP A USER
FIND THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION BEING SOUGHT SINCE IT RETURNS THE COMPLETE DATABASE
THIS LEADS TO THE GENERAL STATEMENT ENHANCING WEIGHTING ALGORITHMS THAT THE WEIGHT
ASSIGNED TO AN ITEM SHOULD BE INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE
OF AN ITEM IN

STATISTICAL STRATEGIES COVER THE BROADEST RANGE OF INDEXING 
TECHNIQUES AND ARE THE MOST PREVALENT IN COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS 
THE BASIS FOR A STATISTICAL APPROACH IS USE OF FREQUENCY OF 
OCCURRENCE OF EVENTS THE EVENTS USUALLY ARE RELATED TO 
OCCURRENCES OF PROCESSING TOKENS (WORDS/PHRASES) WITHIN 
DOCUMENTS AND WITHIN THE DATABASE THE WORDS PHRASES ARE THE 
DOMAIN OF SEARCHABLE VALUES THE STATISTICS THAT ARE APPLIED TO

CALCULATING A PROBABILITY THAT A PARTICULAR ITEM SATISFIES IS 
RELEVANT TO A PARTICULAR QUERY BAYESIAN AND VECTOR 
APPROACHES STORE INFORMATION USED IN GENERATING A RELATIVE 
CONFIDENCE LEVEL OF AN ITEMS RELEVANCE TO A QUERY IT CAN BE 
ARGUED THAT THE BAYESIAN APPROACH IS PROBABILISTIC BUT TO DATE

RELATIVE RELEVANCE VALUE THAN PRODUCING AND ABSOLUTE

THE CONCEPT OF STEMMING HAS BEEN APPLIED TO INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS FROM THEIR INITIAL AUTOMATION IN THE 1960S THE ORIGINAL 
GOAL OF STEMMING WAS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND REQUIRE LESS 
SYSTEM RESOURCES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE WORDS 
THAT A SYSTEM HAS TO CONTAIN WITH THE CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT 
INCREASE IN STORAGE AND COMPUTING POWER USE OF STEMMING FOR 
PERFORMANCE REASONS IS NO LONGER AS IMPORTANT STEMMING IS 
NOW BEING REVIEWED FOR THE POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IT CAN 
MAKE IN RECALL VERSUS ITS ASSOCIATED DECLINE IN PRECISION A 
SYSTEM DESIGNER CAN TRADE OFF THE INCREASED OVERHEAD OF 
STEMMING IN CREATING PROCESSING TOKENS VERSUS REDUCED SEARCH 
TIME OVERHEAD OF PROCESSING QUERY TERMS WITH TRAILING DON'T 
CARES SEE SECTION 215 TERM MASKING TO INCLUDE ALL OF THEIR 
VARIANTS THE STEMMING PROCESS CREATES ONE LARGE INDEX FOR THE 
STEM VERSUS TERM MASKING WHICH REQUIRES THE MERGING ORING OF 
THE INDEXES FOR EVERY TERM THAT MATCHES THE SEARCH TERM

OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND TO IMPROVE RECALL 
CONFLATION IS THE TERM FREQUENTLY USED TO REFER TO 
MAPPING MULTIPLE MORPHOLOGICAL VARIANTS TO A SINGLE 
REPRESENTATION STEM THE PREMISE IS THAT THE STEM CARRIES 
THE MEANING OF THE CONCEPT ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD AND 
THE AFFIXES ENDINGS INTRODUCE SUBTLE MODIFICATIONS TO THE
CONCEPT OR ARE USED FOR SYNTACTICAL PURPOSES LANGUAGES 
HAVE PRECISE GRAMMARS THAT DEFINE THEIR USAGE BUT ALSO
EVOLVE BASED UPON HUMAN USAGE THUS EXCEPTIONS AND NON
CONSISTENT VARIANTS ARE ALWAYS PRESENT IN LANGUAGES THAT
TYPICALLY REQUIRE EXCEPTION LOOK UP TABLES IN ADDITION 
TO THE NORMAL REDUCTION RULES
AT FIRST GLANCE THE IDEA OF EQUATING MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS
OF A WORD AS A SINGLE STEM TERM WOULD APPEAR TO PROVIDE
SIGNIFICANT COMPRESSION WITH ASSOCIATED SAVINGS IN STORAGE
AND PROCESSING FOR EXAMPLE THE STEM COMPUT COULD ASSOCIATE
COMPUTABLE COMPUTABILITY COMPUTATION COMPUTATIONAL
COMPUTED COMPUTING COMPUTER COMPUTERESE COMPUTERIZE 
TO ONE COMPRESSED WORD BUT UPON CLOSER EXAMINATION LOOKING
AT AN INVERTED FILE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION THE SAVINGS IS ONLY 
IN THE DICTIONARY SINCE WEIGHTED POSITIONAL INFORMATION IS
TYPICALLY NEEDED IN THE INVERSION LISTS IN AN ARCHITECTURE WITH
 STEMMING THE INFORMATION IS IN THE ONE INVERSION LIST FOR THE
STEM TERM VERSUS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS MULTIPLE INVERSION LISTS
FOR EACH UNSTEMMED TERM SINCE THE SIZE OF THE INVERSION LISTS
ARE THE MAJOR STORAGE FACTOR THE COMPRESSION OF STEMMING DOES 
NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALL
TEST DATABASES SUCH AS THE CRANFIELD COLLECTION LENNON
REPORTED SAVINGS OF 32 PER CENT LENNON 81 BUT WHEN APPLIED 
TO LARGER DATABASES OF 1 6 MEGABYTES AND 50 MEGABYTES THE
COMPRESSION REDUCED RESPECTIVELY TO 20 PERCENT AND 13 5
PERCENT HARMAN 91 HARMAN ALSO POINTS OUT THAT MISSPELLINGS
AND PROPER NAMES REDUCE THE COMPRESSION EVEN MORE IN A LARGE
TEXT CORPUS SUCH AS THE TREC DATABASE OVER 15 PER CENT OF THE
UNIQUE WORDS ARE PROPER NOUNS OR ACRONYMS THAT SHOULD NOT
BE STEMMED

THE NATURE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IS THAT ITEMS ARE SELDOM 
IF EVER MODIFIED ONCE THEY ARE PRODUCED MOST COMMERCIAL
SYSTEMS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS FACT BY ALLOWING DOCUMENT
FILES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED INVERSION LISTS TO GROW TO A CERTAIN 
MAXIMUM SIZE AND THEN TO FREEZE THEM STARTING A NEW STRUCTURE 
EACH OF THESE DATABASES OF DOCUMENT FILE
DICTIONARY INVERSION LISTS IS ARCHIVED AND MADE AVAILABLE 
FOR A USERíS QUERY THIS HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT FOR 
QUERIES ONLY INTERESTED IN MORE RECENT INFORMATION ONLY 
THE LATEST DATABASES NEED TO BE SEARCHED SINCE OLDER 
ITEMS ARE SELDOM DELETED OR MODIFIED THE ARCHIVED 
DATABASES MAY BE PERMANENTLY BACKED UP THUS SAVING 
ON OPERATIONS OVERHEAD STARTING A NEW INVERTED DATABASE 
HAS SIGNIFICANT OVERHEAD IN ADDING NEW WORDS AND 
INVERSION LISTS UNTIL THE FREQUENTLY FOUND WORDS ARE ADDED 
TO THE DICTIONARY AND INVERSION LISTS PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE 
OF ARCHIVED DATABASES CAN BE USED TO ESTABLISH AN 
EXISTING DICTIONARY AND INVERSION STRUCTURE AT THE START OF 
A NEW DATABASE THUS SAVING SIGNIFICANT OVERHEAD DURING 
THE INITIAL ADDING OF NEW DOCUMENTS 
INVERSION LISTS STRUCTURES ARE USED BECAUSE THEY 
PROVIDE OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE IN SEARCHING LARGE 
DATABASES THE OPTIMALITY COMES FROM THE MINIMIZATION OF 
DATA FLOW IN RESOLVING A QUERY ONLY DATA DIRECTLY RELATED 
TO THE QUERY ARE RETRIEVED FROM SECONDARY STORAGE 
ALSO THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED TO 
OPTIMIZE THE RESOLUTION OF THE QUERY BASED UPON 
INFORMATION MAINTAINED IN THE DICTIONARY 
INVERSION LIST FILE STRUCTURES ARE WELL SUITED TO 
STORE CONCEPTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS EACH INVERSION LIST 
CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS REPRESENTING A PARTICULAR CONCEPT 
THE INVERSION LIST IS THEN A CONCORDANCE OF ALL OF THE 
ITEMS THAT CONTAIN THAT CONCEPT FINER RESOLUTION OF 
CONCEPTS CAN ADDITIONALLY BE MAINTAINED BY STORING 
LOCATIONS WITH AN ITEM AND WEIGHTS OF THE ITEM IN THE 
INVERSION LISTS WITH THIS INFORMATION RELATIONSHIPS 
BETWEEN CONCEPTS CAN BE DETERMINED AS PART OF 
SEARCH ALGORITHMS SEE CHAPTER 7 LOCATION OF CONCEPTS 
IS MADE EASY BY THEIR LISTING IN THE DICTIONARY AND 
INVERSION LISTS FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

DATA STRUCTURES PROVIDE THE IMPLEMENTATION BASIS OF 
SEARCH TECHNIQUES IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS THEY 
MAY BE SEARCHING THE TEXT DIRECTLY AS IN USE OF SIGNATURE 
AND POSSIBLY PAT TREES OR PROVIDING THE STRUCTURE TO HOLD 
THE SEARCHABLE DATA STRUCTURE CREATED BY PROCESSING THE

TO UNDERSTAND IS THE INVERTED FILE SYSTEM IT HAS THE 
GREATEST APPLICABILITY IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS THE USE OF 
N GRAMS HAS ALSO FOUND SUCCESSES IN A LIMITED NUMBER 
OF COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS EVEN THOUGH N GRAMS 
HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUCCESSES IN FINDING INFORMATION IT IS NOT

PASSAGE SEARCHING PROVIDES IMPROVED PRECISION BUCKLEY 95 WILKINSON 95  
RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE SEARCH STATEMENT TO BE SATISFIED ANYWHERE WITHIN A 
DOCUMENT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE SATISFIED WITHIN A 100 WORD CONTIGUOUS 
SUBSET OF THE ITEM CALLAN 94

THE DISTANCE OPERATOR  M  IS AN INTEGER NUMBER AND UNITS ARE IN CHARACTERS  
WORDS  SENTENCES  OR PARAGRAPHS   CERTAIN ITEMS MAY HAVE OTHER SEMANTIC 
UNITS THAT WOULD PROVE USEFUL IN SPECIFYING THE PROXIMITY OPERATION   FOR 
VERY STRUCTURED ITEMS  DISTANCES IN CHARACTERS PROVE USEFUL  FOR ITEMS 
CONTAINING IMBEDDED IMAGES  E G   DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS   TEXT BETWEEN THE 
IMAGES COULD HELP IN PRECISION WHEN THE OBJECTIVE IS IN LOCATING A CERTAIN 
IMAGE   SOMETIMES THE PROXIMITY RELATIONSHIP CONTAINS A DIRECTION OPERATOR 
INDICATING THE DIRECTION  BEFORE OR AFTER  THAT THE SECOND TERM MUST BE 
FOUND WITHIN THE NUMBER OF UNITS SPECIFIED   THE DEFAULT IS EITHER DIRECTION 
A SPECIAL CASE OF THE PROXIMITY OPERATOR IS THE ADJACENT  ADJ  OPERATOR 
THAT NORMALLY HAS A DISTANCE OPERATOR OF ONE AND A FORWARD ONLY DIRECTION  I 
E   IN WAIS

ADK

A CONTIGUOUS WORD PHRASE ALSO ACTS LIKE A SPECIAL SEARCH OPERATOR THAT IS 
SIMILAR TO THE PROXIMITY  ADJACENCY  OPERATOR BUT ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL 
SPECIFICITY   IF TWO TERMS ARE SPECIFIED  THE CONTIGUOUS WORD PHRASE AND THE 
PROXIMITY OPERATOR USING DIRECTIONAL ONE WORD PARAMETERS OR THE ADJACENT 
OPERATOR ARE IDENTICAL   FOR CONTIGUOUS WORD PHRASES OF MORE THAN TWO TERMS 
THE ONLY WAY OF CREATING AN EQUIVALENT SEARCH STATEMENT USING PROXIMITY AND 
BOOLEAN OPERATORS IS VIA NESTED ADJACENCIES WHICH ARE NOT FOUND IN MOST 
COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS   THIS IS BECAUSE PROXIMITY AND BOOLEAN OPERATORS ARE 
BINARY OPERATORS  BUT CONTIGUOUS WORD PHRASES ARE  AN  N ARY OPERATOR WHERE  
N  IS THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN THE CWP

IN ADDITION TO THE COMPLEXITIES IN GENERATING A QUERY  QUITE OFTEN THE USER IS 
NOT AN EXPERT IN THE AREA THAT IS BEING SEARCHED AND LACKS DOMAIN SPECIFIC VOCABULARY 
UNIQUE TO THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT AREA  THE USER  STARTS THE SEARCH PROCESS WITH A 
GENERAL CONCEPT OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BUT NOT HAVE A FOCUSED DEFINITION OF 
EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED  A LIMITED  KNOWLEDGE OF  THE VOCABULARY ASSOCIATED WITH A 
PARTICULAR AREA ALONG WITH LACK OF FOCUS ON EXACTLY WHAT INFORMATION IS NEEDED LEADS 
TO USE OF INACCURATE AND IN SOME CASES MISLEADING SEARCH TERMS  EVEN WHEN THE USER 
IS AN EXPERT IN THE AREA BEING SEARCHED  THE ABILITY TO SELECT THE PROPER SEARCH TERMS 
IS CONSTRAINED BY LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE AUTHORS VOCABULARY  ALL WRITERS HAVE A 
VOCABULARY LIMITED BY THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY WERE RAISED

ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH BOOLEAN AND NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERIES IS THE ABILITY 
TO EXPAND THE SEARCH TERMS VIA THESAURUS OR CONCEPT CLASS DATABASE REFERENCE TOOL
A THESAURUS IS TYPICALLY A ONELEVEL OR TWOLEVEL EXPANSION OF A TERM TO OTHER TERMS
THAT ARE SIMILAR IN MEANING  A CONCEPT CLASS IS A TREE STRUCTURE THAT EXPANDS EACH
MEANING OF A WORD INTO POTENTIAL CONCEPTS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE INITIAL TERM EG IN
THE TOPIC SYSTEM  CONCEPT CLASSES ARE SOMETIMES IMPLEMENTED AS A NETWORK
STRUCTURE THAT LINKS WORD STEMS EG IN THE RETRIEVALWARE SYSTEM  AN EXAMPLE OF
THESAURUS AND  CONCEPT CLASS STRUCTURES ARE SHOWN IN FIGURE 24 THESAURUS93
AND FIGURE 25 CONCEPT CLASS REPRESENTATIONS ASSIST A USER WHO HAS MINIMAL
KNOWLEDGE OF A CONCEPT DOMAIN BY ALLOWING THE USER TO EXPAND UPON A PARTICULAR

THERE ARE TWO FACTORS INVOLVED IN DECIDING ON WHAT LEVEL TO INDEX THE
CONCEPTS IN AN ITEM THE EXHAUSTIVITY AND THE SPECIFICITY OF INDEXING DESIRED
EXHAUSTIVITY OF INDEXING IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS IN THE ITEM ARE
INDEXED  FOR EXAMPLE IF TWO SENTENCES OF A 10PAGE ITEM ON MICROPROCESSORS
DISCUSSES ONBOARD CACHES SHOULD THIS CONCEPT BE INDEXED  SPECIFICITY RELATES TO
THE PRECISENESS OF THE INDEX TERMS USED IN INDEXING  FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER THE TERM
PROCESSOR OR THE TERM MICROCOMPUTER OR THE TERM PENTIUM SHOULD BE USED IN
THE INDEX OF AN ITEM IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFICITY DECISION  INDEXING AN ITEM ONLY ON
THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT IN IT AND USING GENERAL INDEX TERMS YIELDS LOW
EXHAUSTIVITY AND SPECIFICITY  THIS APPROACH REQUIRES A MINIMAL NUMBER OF INDEX
